<DD>An extended shutdown of the nation’s only scientific laboratory for producing and testing the plutonium cores for its nuclear weapons has taken a toll on America’s arsenal, with key work postponed and delays looming in the production of components for new nuclear warheads, according to government documents and officials.

The unique research and production facility is located at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, the birthplace of the U.S. atomic arsenal. The lab’s director ordered the shutdown in 2013 after the Washington official in charge of America’s warhead production expressed worries that the facility was ill-equipped to prevent an accident that would kill its workers and potentially others nearby.

<DD>On August 15th 1977, a radio telescope located at Ohio State University detected something strange. The telescope was scanning the stars searching for possible signals from alien civilizations as part of the SETI project, and on that date it found something. The telescope recorded an incredibly strong signal appearing to come from somewhere in the direction of Sagittarius; the signal only lasted about a minute and was never detected again.

The signal was so strong that astronomer Jerry Ehman, who first spotted it, circled it in red pen and wrote "Wow!" in the margin. The "Wow! signal," as it would come to be known, became the best evidence ever obtained for extraterrestrial life.

At least, until now. One astronomer believes he's figured out what really caused the Wow! signal and—spoiler alert—it's not aliens.

<DD>The Utah teapot, or the Newell teapot, is a 3D computer model that has become a standard reference object (and something of an in-joke) in the computer graphics community. It is a mathematical model of an ordinary teapot of fairly simple shape, that appears solid, cylindrical and partially convex. A teapot primitive is considered the equivalent of a "hello, world" program, as a way to create an easy 3D scene with a somewhat complex model acting as a basic geometry reference for scene and light setup. Many[citation needed] programming libraries even have functions dedicated to drawing teapots.

The teapot model was created in 1975 by early computer graphics researcher Martin Newell, a member of the pioneering graphics program at the University of Utah.

<DD>n the motion picture industry a China Girl is an image of a woman accompanied by color bars that appears for a few frames (typically one to four) in the reel leader. A "China Girl" was used by the lab technician for calibration purposes when processing the film (with the still photography equivalent being a "Shirley Card"). The origin of the term is a matter of some dispute but is usually accepted to be a reference to the models used to create the frames - either they were actually china (porcelain) mannequins, or the make-up worn by the live models made them appear to be mannequins.

Roger, a young magazine writer for GQ and the New York Times among others, did not expect this kind of attention. He knew lots of people, from bowling-alley-hanging teens to the Music & Amusement Association, were depending on him, but didn’t realize the whole country would be watching. Roger had been selected for this particular task not only for his knowledge and expertise, but for his legendary hand-eye coordination. He was there to prove that this was a game of skill, not chance. He was there to overturn the ban. He was there to save the game of pinball.

Bingo machines are gambling machines !

Pinball is only for entertainment, you pay to play a game and have fun.
Bingo machines are totally different, you put money in them (usually more features are lit when you put more money in them) and the sole purpose of the machine is to win credits / money with the game.
Although it is not always legal to do so, usually the credits (and thus money) earned by a player can be paid out by the location owner (who has a way to reset the credit counter back to zero).

<DD>SN76477 "complex sound generator" was a sound chip produced by Texas Instruments (TI). The chip came to market in 1978, and TI production of the part ceased some time ago. More recently, a 100% compatible version, identified as ICS76477, has been listed as 'in stock' by at least one US-based component stockist. The chip was typically used as a sound effects generator in arcade games and toys and for hobby projects.

Currently, the best method of preserving these computers with SCSI drives is the SCSI2SD device designed by [Michael McMaster]. While this device does exactly what it says it’ll do — turn an SD card into a drive on a SCSI chain — it’s fairly expensive at $70.

[Gokhan] has a better, cheaper solution. It’s a SCSI device emulator for the Raspberry Pi. It turns a Raspberry Pi into a SCSI hard drive, magneto-optical drive, CDROM, or an Ethernet adapter using only some glue logic and a bit of code.

SSM and CEM were the two top manufacturers for chips used in many of the classic vintage synthesizers you have come to love. CEM stood for Curtis Electromusic Specialties and is now Curtis Electromusic, run by the family of the late Doug Curtis.

The residential tenants, who will be evicted first are the most vulnerable, many of them are unable to find similarly priced affordable housing, and will likely end up in Toronto's shelter system.  Included in this group is a woman who is battling cancer, and a First Nation's (Danny Beaton pictured above) elder who has been in the building for almost 30 years.

There is currently an outstanding certificate of pending litigation between one of the commercial tenants and the above landlords, as the commercial tenant had a right of first refusal to purchase the building in their lease.

<DD>The yellow blobs of slime mold normally grow in dark forests, not on computer chips or on gelatinous squares shaped like the United States. But through his research, University of the West of England professor Andrew Adamatzky has shown that the mold can, and should, be grown elsewhere because of its potential in computing.

Physarum polycephalum is a brainless mold that’s sole purpose is to build transportation networks for the nutrients that sustain it. As it expands in search of food, it sends out slimy tubes that continue to branch out until it finds a food source, at which point it forms a blob around the nutrients. Its slime tubes then continue to grow and split until the mold forms a network of tubes to transport the food throughout itself.

This project and its inspiration have a few things in common. They’re both assembled on perfboard, using tiny tact switches for the keyboard. The display is a standard TFT display easily sourced from eBay, Amazon, or Aliexpress. There’s a speaker for terribad Apple II audio on both, and gigantic 5 1/4″ floppies have been shrunk down to the size of an SD card. That’s where the similarities end.

<DD>The Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (reporting marks C&O, CO) was a Class I railroad formed in 1869 in Virginia from several smaller Virginia railroads begun in the 19th century. Led by industrialist Collis P. Huntington, it reached from Virginia's capital city of Richmond to the Ohio River by 1873, where the railroad town (and later city) of Huntington, West Virginia was named for him.

Tapping the coal reserves of West Virginia, the C&O's Peninsula Extension to new coal piers on the harbor of Hampton Roads resulted in the creation of the new City of Newport News. Coal revenues also led the forging of a rail link to the Midwest, eventually reaching Columbus, Cincinnati and Toledo in Ohio and Chicago, Illinois.

By the early 1960s the C&O was headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. In 1972, under the leadership of Cyrus Eaton, it became part of the Chessie System, along with the Baltimore and Ohio and Western Maryland Railway. The Chessie System was later combined with the Seaboard Coast Line and Louisville and Nashville, both the primary components of the Family Lines System, to become a key portion of CSX Transportation (CSXT) in the 1980s. A substantial portion of Conrail was added in 1999.

<DD>New York, NY (March 29, 2017)—When Bonhams announced that it would be selling the 1970s Abbey Road Studios EMI TG12345 MK IV recording console used to record Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, expectations were high. Indeed, the auction house cautioned in the desk’s catalogue listing, “The department advises that the estimate, although unpublished, is a significant six-figure sum.” Bonhams has since revealed that the pre-auction estimate was $700,000, but the console’s anonymous buyer blew right by that on March 27, purchasing the unusual piece of rock history for an eye-watering $1,807,500.

<DD>Neural networks are computer learning algorithms that mimic the interconnected neurons of a living brain, managing astonishing feats of image classification, speech recognition, or music generation by forming connections between simulated neurons.

I’m not a neural network researcher, but there’s never been a better time to experiment with them, thanks to open-source packages like torch, a scientific computing framework with built-in neural network capabilities. Inspired by Tom Brewe’s neural network-generated recipes, and enabled by the open-source torch add-on for character-based neural networks by Andrej Karpathy, I fired up the neural network code on my 2010 Macbook Pro, and started training it on a bunch of recipes I downloaded from a collection by David Shields.

<DD>Jet lag makes everyone miserable. But it makes some people mentally ill.

There’s a psychiatric hospital not far from Heathrow Airport that is known for treating bipolar and schizophrenic travelers, some of whom are occasionally found wandering aimlessly through the terminals. A study from the 1980s of 186 of those patients found that those who’d traveled from the west had a higher incidence of mania, while those who’d traveled from the east had a higher incidence of depression.

I saw the same thing in one of my patients who suffered from manic depression. When he got depressed after a vacation to Europe, we assumed he was just disappointed about returning to work. But then he had a fun trip out West and returned home in what’s called a hypomanic state: He was expansive, a fount of creative ideas.

It was clear that his changes in mood weren’t caused by the vacation blues, but by something else. The problem turned out to be a disruption in his circadian rhythm. He didn’t need drugs; he needed the right doses of sleep and sunlight at the right time.

<DD>The ground shook, a brilliant white flash enveloped the sky, and the world changed forever. Code name "Trinity," the bomb test at dawn on July 16, 1945 in Alamogordo, New Mexico was the first large-scale atomic weapons testing in history. Only three weeks later two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan.

More than 1,900 miles away from Alamogordo, at the Rochester, NY headquarters of Eastman Kodak, a flood of complaints came in from business customers who had recently purchased sensitive X-ray film from the company. Black exposed spots on the film, or "fogging," had rendered it unusable. This perplexed many Kodak scientists, who had gone to great lengths to prevent contaminations like this.

<DD>The revolutionary Intel 8008 microprocessor is 45 years old today (March 13, 2017), so I figured it’s time for a blog post on reverse-engineering its internal circuits. One of the interesting things about old computers is how they implemented things in unexpected ways, and the 8008 is no exception. Compared to modern architectures, one unusual feature of the 8008 is it had an on-chip stack for subroutine calls, rather than storing the stack in RAM. And instead of using normal binary counters for the stack, the 8008 saved a few gates by using shift-register counters that generated pseudo-random values. In this article, I reverse-engineer these circuits from die photos and explain how they work.

<DD>The Dover group Water Wells First, with help from the Ontario Ground Water Association, has filed a notice of appeal of the agreement between the North Kent Wind 1 project and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change to build up to 50 wind turbines.

In a recent press conference on the property of Dover farmer Laurier Cartier, Water Wells First led by Kevin Jakubec, said until the ministry investigates the sediment problem with up to 20 wells in the Dover Twp. area they believe is caused by vibration from the wind turbines, they will continue to object to the project.

Holding a brown and clogged water filter from the filtration system he installed in his kitchen, Cartier said the sediment problem started the day they started pile driving the footings for the turbines. Jakubec said Cartier is just one of many farmers who put in filtration systems.

It rises about 80 metres (260 ft) above the surrounding Teltow plateau and 120.1 metres (394 ft) above the sea level, in the north of Berlin's Grunewald Forest. It was named after the Teufelssee (i.e. Devil's lake) in its southerly vicinity. The hill is made of rubble, and covers an under-construction Nazi military-technical college (Wehrtechnische Fakultät). During the Cold War, there was a U.S. listening station on the hill, Field Station Berlin.

<DD>Eliane Radigue

Her life journey has been remarkable. At the end of the fifties, she studied in Paris with musique concrète pioneers Pierre Schaeffer and Pierre Henry, whom she also assisted, notably for the premiere of L'Apocalypse de Jean. During the sixties she began composing with primitive electronics (feedback and asynchronous tape loops), but found little recognition for her research in France.

In New York in the early seventies, she found understanding and emulation, exploring emerging minimalism with James Tenney, Charlemagne Palestine, Phillip Glass, John Gibson, and Steve Reich. Her absolute allegiance to electronic sounds began during this period. Since then she has composed on the best synthesizers of the time: Buchla, Moog, Serge, and then ARP, which would become her fetish instrument. She collaborated with Robert Ashley, who sang on Les Chants de Milarepa. She has composed about two dozen works, which she has presented and continues to present at numerous prestigious...

<DD>The Illuminati (plural of Latin illuminatus, "enlightened") is a name given to several groups, both real and fictitious. Historically, the name usually refers to the Bavarian Illuminati, an Enlightenment-era secret society founded on 1 May 1776. The society's goals were to oppose superstition, obscurantism, religious influence over public life and abuses of state power. "The order of the day," they wrote in their general statutes, "is to put an end to the machinations of the purveyors of injustice, to control them without dominating them". The Illuminati—along with Freemasonry and other secret societies—were outlawed through edict, by the Bavarian ruler, Charles Theodore, with the encouragement of the Roman Catholic Church, in 1784, 1785, 1787 and 1790. In the several years following, the group was vilified by conservative and religious critics who claimed that they continued underground and were responsible for the French Revolution.

<DD>As Monty Python might say: "Now for something completely different." In the course of human history what I'm about to describe amounts, at most, to a bit of amusing trivia. But it's a trivia I was around to witness by improbable connections, mentioned below. If you would, please join with me as we set the way-back machine to over four decades ago, sometime in the mid 60s. The story begins with an idea then making the audio rounds, one which was an offshoot of the video tape recorder. Most VTRs at the time used something called a rotating head drum. It was a novel way to obtain a very fast head-to-tape speed, as the head gaps whirled along narrow tracks angled on the tape. Meanwhile, the tape itself chugged along at a regular modest speed. That trick gave us the high frequencies video requires, without running out of tape every 5-10 minutes (pretty clever). Home VCRs yet to come would use the very same principle.

<DD>Ambient music is a genre of music that puts an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an "atmospheric", "visual", or "unobtrusive" quality. According to Brian Eno, one of its pioneers, "Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."

As a genre, it originated in the United Kingdom at a time when new sound-making devices were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. Ambient developed in the 1970s from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period. The work of Tangerine Dream, Cluster and composer Erik Satie, as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel's Environments series, were all influences on the emergence of ambient. Brian Eno named and popularized ambient music in 1978 with his album Ambient 1: Music for Airports.

applications and the requirements for electrical isolation, small size, and low-power consumption. For each module, designers often scramble to find the right voltage regulator controller, the right transformer, inductor, and discrete transistors to fit their application. In this article, we take a look at a new power methodology that accelerates isolated power supply design, as highlighted by six readily available  reference designs that support applications from 2W to 40W.

<DD>RS-485 continues to be the physical layer workhorse for reliable data transmission in a wide diversity of applications. An evolving environment means that the physical implementation must adapt to the availability of lower input voltages and more 
stringent ESD specifications, while remaining cost effective. In this article, we will discuss the challenge of meeting these requirements and will propose a highly integrated solution. This solution manages to hit the sweet spot between cost and performance for applications requiring mid-grade levels of electro-static device (ESD) protection.

<DD>In the last 10 years, Google Translate has grown from supporting just a few languages to 103, translating over 140 billion words every day. To make this possible, we needed to build and maintain many different systems in order to translate between any two languages, incurring significant computational cost. With neural networks reforming many fields, we were convinced we could raise the translation quality further, but doing so would mean rethinking the technology behind Google Translate. In September, we announced that Google Translate is switching to a new system called Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT), an end-to-end learning framework that learns from millions of examples, and provided significant improvements in translation quality. However, while switching to GNMT improved the quality for the languages we tested it on, scaling up to all the 103 supported languages presented a significant challenge.

<DD>Have you ever had to decide between a general purpose tool and one built for a very specific purpose? The general purpose tools can be used to solve many different problems, but may not be the best choice for any particular one. Purpose-built tools excel at one task, but you may need to do that particular task infrequently.

Computer engineers face this problem when designing architectures and instruction sets, almost always pursuing an approach that delivers good performance across a very wide range of workloads. From time to time, new types of workloads and working conditions emerge that are best addressed by custom hardware. This requires another balancing act: trading off the potential for incredible performance vs. a development life cycle often measured in quarters or years.

But Microsoft owns the series now and has far more money to throw at it than former owners/Unreal Engine creators Epic Games did. With help from Microsoft Research, Redmond's Gears of War factory The Coalition found a high tech way to fix that problem. It's called Triton.

The BMP180 barometric sensor (model GY-68) is the one in the following figure (front and back view). It is a very small module with 1mm x 1.1mm (0.039in x 0.043in). It measures the absolute pressure of the air around it. It has a measuring range from 300 to 1100hPa with an accuracy down to 0.02 hPa. It can also measure altitude and temperature. The BMP180 barometric sensor communicates via I2C interface. This means that it communicates with the Arduino using just 2 pins.

<DD>A Nixie tube, or cold cathode display, is an electronic device for displaying numerals or other information using glow discharge.

The glass tube contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes, shaped like numerals or other symbols. Applying power to one cathode surrounds it with an orange glow discharge. The tube is filled with a gas at low pressure, usually mostly neon and often a little mercury or argon, in a Penning mixture.

Although it resembles a vacuum tube in appearance, its operation does not depend on thermionic emission of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), or a variant of neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40 °C (104 °F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode, and shaped bare metal cathodes.

The latter one was quite successful and later allowed me to finance my nixie tube exploration.

I love old things. Old cars, old houses, old electronics.. I am fascinated by the fact that those things have survived tens, hundreds of years and some are still serving their original purpose while people who made them passed away long time ago. And this is the key idea of my business – I want to produce robust, durable objects that people will cherish long time after I won’t be there!

In 1977, Radio Shack's 3,000 stores started selling the TRS-80 (Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor). Largely forgotten by the general public, the TRS-80 was, with Apple and Commodore's products, one of the pioneering personal computers of the late 1970s, and a key machine in the personal computer revolution. Byte magazine described the "1977 Trinity" of computers: Apple, Commodore and Tandy.

In 1981, the year of this catalog, the TRS-80 earned the nicknamed "Trash-80." Computer designer and writer Adam Osbourne described Tandy and Radio Shack as "the number-one microcomputer manufacturer."

The low power consumption of the new ADXL354 and ADXL355 accelerometers lengthens battery life and allows extended product usage by reducing the time between battery changes. The low noise performance of the ADXL354 and ADXL355 with low power consumption makes it now possible to cost-effectively enable low-level vibration measurement applications such as Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). Additionally, the tilt stability of ADXL354 and ADXL355 accelerometers delivers excellent repeatability over temperature and time, which is ideal for orientation and navigation systems in unmanned aerial vehicles using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and inclinometers. By providing repeatable tilt measurement under all conditions, the new accelerometers enable minimal tilt error without extensive calibration in harsh environments.

<DD>Hans Faulkner traveled to the Nevada desert in August 2015 with one thing on his mind: Aliens.

Faulkner wanted catch a glimpse of Area 51. He was working on a documentary project about advanced aircraft — and possibly alien — technology. While he was there, he explored the area up to the posted warning signs, and sent up a drone to capture some pretty amazing footage. “Approaching Area 51 you wouldn’t know anything was there,” he tells Inverse in an email. “Its location is perfectly hidden behind several mountains.”

<DD>ING Bank’s main data center in Bucharest, Romania, was severely damaged over the weekend during a fire extinguishing test. In what is a very rare but known phenomenon, it was the loud sound of inert gas being released that destroyed dozens of hard drives. The site is currently offline and the bank relies solely on its backup data center, located within a couple of miles’ proximity.

“The drill went as designed, but we had collateral damage”, ING’s spokeswoman in Romania told me, confirming the inert gas issue. Local clients were unable to use debit cards and to perform online banking operations on Saturday between 1PM and 11PM because of the test. “Our team is investigating the incident,” she said.

<DD>Surround sound and 4K TVs are great for watching movies at home, but there's still nothing like sitting in front of a gigantic screen in an IMAX theater. I recently got an exclusive first look at the company's next-generation digital laser projectors, and I walked away from the experience wanting to see every single movie remastered and projected using the new technology.

What the company has developed for the future will change the movie theater experience for decades: the gigantic images the company is known for are now bright and sharp enough to reveal every last detail that filmmakers and cinematographers worked hard to capture. Colors are so bright and intense that they now add even more realism to computer-generated images. And contrast is so distinct that when watching footage from the International Space Station you feel as if you're actually staring into the blackness of space.

<DD>I have an old PDP11 memory board with a bunch of 41256 DRAM chips that need testing. I was a bit surprise surprised at the lack of DRAM tester projects that I could find. I did find one based on a PIC, but nothing on an ARM/Arduino. So I built this.

It is basically a bread boarded Arduino UNO. The sketch runs four tests. The first loop loads all zeros in the memory and then will read them back. The second loop loads all ones. Loop three and four load alternate 1’s and 0’s.

There are three LED’s. The green LED will light until an error occurs. The red LED is dual function. If all four loops pass it will blink several times and then the four loops will repeat. If any of the loops fails only the RED LED will remain lit. The blue LED will light and stay lit if the first set of 4 tests passed.

<DD>Brazil is a 1985 British film directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Gilliam, Charles McKeown, and Tom Stoppard. British National Cinema by Sarah Street describes the film as a "fantasy/satire on bureaucratic society" while John Scalzi's Rough Guide to Sci-Fi Movies describes it as a "dystopian satire". The film stars Jonathan Pryce and features Robert De Niro, Kim Greist, Michael Palin, Katherine Helmond, Bob Hoskins, and Ian Holm.

The film centres on Sam Lowry, a man trying to find a woman who appears in his dreams while he is working in a mind-numbing job and living a life in a small apartment, set in a consumer-driven dystopian world in which there is an over-reliance on poorly maintained (and rather whimsical) machines. Brazil's bureaucratic, totalitarian government is reminiscent of the government depicted in George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, except that it has a buffoonish, slapstick quality and lacks a Big Brother figure.

<DD>Question: The stability of my fully differential and voltage feedback amplifiers seems highly impacted by the value of my feedback resistors—the RF/RG ratio is always correct, so what’s happening?

Answer: When a signal needs gain, an amplifier is the component of choice. The ratio of the feedback and gain resistors, RF/RG, for a voltage feedback and a fully differential amplifier, determines the gain. Once the ratio is set, the next step is to select a value for either RF or RG. The choice of RF can impact the stability of the amplifier.

<DD>Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR, pronounced crisper) are segments of prokaryotic DNA containing short repetitions of base sequences. Each repetition is followed by short segments of "spacer DNA" from previous exposures to a bacteriophage virus or plasmid.

The CRISPR/Cas system is a prokaryotic immune system that confers resistance to foreign genetic elements such as those present within plasmids and phages, and provides a form of acquired immunity. CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) use the CRISPR spacers to recognize and cut these exogenous genetic elements in a manner analogous to RNA interference in eukaryotic organisms. CRISPRs are found in approximately 40% of sequenced bacterial genomes and 90% of sequenced archaea.

<DD>t used to be tedious to set up a cross compile environment. Sure you can compile on the Raspberry Pi itself, but sometimes you want to use your big computer — and you can use it when your Pi is not on hand like when on an airplane with a laptop. It can be tricky to set up a cross compiler for any build tools, but if you go through one simple step, it becomes super easy regardless of what your real computer looks like. That one step is to install Docker.

Docker is available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS. It allows developers to build images that are essentially preconfigured Linux environments that run some service. Like a virtual machine, these images can run together without interfering with each other. Unlike a virtual machine, Docker containers (the running software) are lightweight because they share the same underlying kernel and hardware of the computer.

It defines communications between client side content and a host system (called "the run-time environment"), which is commonly supported by a learning management system. SCORM also defines how content may be packaged into a transferable ZIP file called "Package Interchange Format."

SCORM is a specification of the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative from the Office of the United States Secretary of Defense.

SCORM 2004 introduced a complex idea called sequencing, which is a set of rules that specifies the order in which a learner may experience content objects. In simple terms, they constrain a learner to a fixed set of paths through the training material, permit the learner to "bookmark" their progress when taking breaks, and assure the acceptability of test scores achieved by the learner. The standard uses XML, and it is based on the results of work done by AICC, IMS Global, IEEE, and Ariadne.

<DD>The Synthesis Toolkit (STK) is an open source API for real time audio synthesis with an emphasis on classes to facilitate the development of physical modelling synthesizers. It is written in C++ and is written and maintained by Perry Cook at Princeton University and Gary Scavone at McGill University. It contains both low-level synthesis and signal processing classes (oscillators, filters, etc.) and higher-level instrument classes which contain examples of most of the currently available physical modelling algorithms in use today. STK is free software, but a number of its classes, particularly some physical modelling algorithms, are covered by patents held by Stanford University and Yamaha.

The STK is used widely in creating software synthesis applications. Versions of the STK instrument classes have been integrated into ChucK, Csound, Real-Time Cmix, Max/MSP (as part of PeRColate), SuperCollider and FAUST. It has been ported to SymbianOS and iOS as well.

They provide smarter ways to use simple things and simpler ways to use smart things. Interfaces release the potential of complex systems and technologies to the users who need them. And every once in a while, they change everything.

We believe user interfaces have been pivotal to some of the world's most important innovations. And since the line between an "interface" and an "invention" can be quite fuzzy, we thought we'd explore that line – and take a tour of how interfaces have changed the world.

At Xerox, we have a long list of our own handy interfaces: The green-means-go button on your copier. The simple, elegant lines of the “hamburger” menu on your cellphone display screen. A “computer partner” that helps cities enforce parking regulations.

So here's a list celebrating our favorite user interface examples.

<DD>In computer programming, SOLID (single responsibility, open-closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation and dependency inversion) is a mnemonic acronym introduced by Michael Feathers for the "first five principles" named by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s that stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design. The intention is that these principles, when applied together, will make it more likely that a programmer will create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time. The principles of SOLID are guidelines that can be applied while working on software to remove code smells by providing a framework through which the programmer may refactor the software's source code until it is both legible and extensible. It is part of an overall strategy of agile and Adaptive Software Development.

But about five years ago, University of Oxford researchers Andrew Markham and Niki Trigoni solved that problem by inventing a wireless tracking system that can work underground. Their system is clever, but they didn’t do it alone. Like many other scientists, they turned to open source to avoid having to rebuild fundamental components from scratch. One building block they used is an open source operating system called Contiki.

<DD>More than 1,000 working satellites orbit Earth. As space becomes increasingly crowded, there’s a greater chance that the satellites’ radio signals could overlap. To avoid that problem, which disrupts communications, satellite antennas must transmit only within a narrow frequency band. The radio frequency anechoic chamber at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) is one of the best places in the world to accurately calibrate antennas. A steel Faraday cage surrounding the chamber blocks interference from external sources, such as Wi-Fi and broadband networks. Inside, foam pyramids stop a satellite’s own radio waves from bouncing around, to ensure that a receiver in the chamber measures only the signals coming directly from the antenna and not reflections. (The pyramids dissipate the signals as they travel from tip to base.) Engineers then use the recorded transmission patterns to adjust, and sometimes rebuild, the antenna. After all, if a satellite fails in space...

In fact, the graduate student at Western University credited his grandparents, who live on a farm outside Sarnia, as the inspiration for his groundbreaking study that looks at how the people of southwestern Ontario speak. 

"[My grandparents] were born about 20 minutes outside Sarnia and they always had an interesting way of speaking to me," he told The Morning Edition host Craig Norris. 

"People who hear it say it sounds very relaxed," he says of the southwestern Ontario accent, noting most people who live outside the region don't even know it exists. 

"That seems to be something that's agreed upon by people," he said. "They sort of see it as Toronto and then it's America south of there." 

According to Iannozzi's research however, that's not the case. He's interviewed 30 people so far in order to document the distinct patterns of speech that are native to southwestern Ontario and the researcher has already noticed some particularities.

We learned to always have several balls in the air at once — while writing something on the computer, we had a phone call going, we were writing something on a notepad or paper form, we were reviewing documents, sometimes even holding a meeting at the same time. That’s the productive worker, the effective executive.

When email and Instant Messaging and blogs and the rest of the Internet came along, multi-tasking went haywire. Now we’re expected to do 10 things on the computer at once, still with the paper, phone, and meetings going, along with texting and Blackberry Messaging. Multi-tasking is no longer about being productive — it’s a way of living.

It’s not a sane way of living, however, and it’s not necessarily the most effective way of working either.

<DD>Some time ago a friend handed me a bare J-11 chip. It had been pulled from some system on the way to scrap, presumably just because it was a pretty object. A few pins were bent and it had not been static-protected - what sort of handling it had seen was unknown. I wondered whether it was now anything more than a pretty object.

The J-11 (more properly the DCJ11, aka "Jaws") was one of the last gasps of the PDP-11 - a CMOS microprocessor implementation of the PDP-11/70. It was two chips actually, mounted on a single 60-pin, over-wide, DIP ceramic carrier. The J-11 was developed in the early 1980s. It was introduced in the PDP-11/73 in 1983/84. Although this was at the end of the heyday of the PDP-11, it saw a relatively long production life, being produced till sometime into the 1990s. The unit here has a date code from 1987.

I had a recollection of hearing that these microprocessors had an ODT (Octal Debugging Technique) built into the microcode. ODT is a simple ASCII-based console monitor. The question was what would be the minimal hardware setup that would allow one to talk to the ODT. In theory, it should just be a matter of appropriately wiring up a UART to the J-11.

It has two functionalities: a can bus module and an onboard Real Time clock powered by a 12 mm battery. The CanBus is based on a couple of MCP2515 SPI controllers and ISO1050 tranceivers. All functionalities are full integrated in standard linux kernel, so, they can be avaible on fly, or at last recompiling linux kernel to add canbus functionalities. The real time clock is based on DS3231 with internal oscillator I2C controller. It is full compatible with linux too. Using I2C Kernel module, and standard kernel functions, date and hour can be set/get by simple commands. On the bottom side is located an on board battery to guarantee a data autonomy more than 20 years. In chapter hardware there are all informations on principal components, schematics to rebuild and modify RaspBerry PI board. The new board is designed with the Raspberry Hat specification. There are four fixing holes and the hardware identification EEPROM (Blank Memory not mounted).

<DD>When the Pi Zero came out, one of the downsides (!) of the low-cost design was swapping the 'standard' USB A-port for a micro-B port. Now you have to use an 'OTG' cable instead of just plugging in a device.

There was also the matter of, if you didn't have anything connected to USB, and powered up the Pi Zero with an old Raspbian image, you'd get a strange warning

WARN::dwc_otg_handle_mode_mismatch_intr:68: Mode Mismatch Interrupt: currently in Device mode

Basically, the Pi sorta-trying to become a usb device rather than a usb host

Some awesome people on github sorted out that if you used the DWC2 USB driver, and patched a few files, you could get the Pi to act like a USB device (in linux-land this is called the USB Gadget system)

<DD> In today’s semiconductor-driven world, it’s easy to forget just how essential vacuum tubes were to electronics—and everyday life—during the middle decades of the 20th century. How essential? Well, it’s no exaggeration to say that one particular type of tube played a crucial role in saving Western civilization.

During the early days of World War II, German U-boats ruled the North Atlantic, attacking and sinking ships almost at will. The British had a new technology, called RADAR (RAdio Detection And Ranging), that could spot U-boats lurking in the waves. But they couldn’t make the hardware small and light enough to use in fighter planes. Fortunately for the British, and posterity, Sigurd and Russell Varian had a solution.

<DD>This tutorial shows you how to incorporate basic gesture recognition into your Arduino projects using the ESP system. For example, you might recognize different tennis gestures like a forehand, backhand, and serve; elements of a dance routine; weight-lifting gestures; etc. The gestures are sensed using an accelerometer and sent to the ESP application running on your computer. ESP uses a simple machine learning algorithm to match the live accelerometer data to recorded examples of different gestures, sending a message back to the Arduino when it recognizes a gesture similar to one of the examples. The system only recognizes individual occurrences of discrete gestures; it doesn't provide information about how the gesture is performed. Still, it can be used for a wide range of interactive applications.

It was a wordless one-page comic about two oddly pointy faced spies, one dressed in black and the other dressed in white. Other than their different colored outfits, they behaved identically. They hated each other and created elaborate Rube Goldberg type machines to try to kill each other. Sometimes their machines worked, often, they’d backfire. They were tricky but usually too clever for their own good.

Atlas Obscura has an excellent article about Antonio Prohías, the creator of Spy vs Spy.

<DD>Designing electronics is complex, and many of the most common mistakes often occur on the Printed Circuit Board (PCB). The PCB is what connects and holds all the electronic components together.

Whether you choose to do the design yourself, or hire an engineer, I strongly encourage you to get a design review from an independent engineer before you produce any prototypes. I always have other engineers review my designs before prototyping. Independent design reviews are one of the best ways to prevent costly errors such as the ones listed below.

<DD>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) on a typical microprocessor board is related to the clock. If the clock is a square wave, it contains frequencies at the clock frequency and harmonics. A perfect square wave clock would have harmonic frequencies at f, 3 × f, 5 × f, 7 × f, and so on. For a perfect square wave, or any string of pulses with a fast rise time, the strength of the harmonics declines inversely with frequency.

Many American engineers have vivid memories of his Mini-Notebooks and his larger work, Getting Started in Electronics. Initially sold in the 1970s only through RadioShack stores (where several titles can still be bought today), these books featured hand-drawn circuit diagrams of educational or interesting projects alongside hand-lettered explanations.

Mims’s folksy format did much to make electronics feel unintimidating. At the same time, his books gently cemented into readers’ minds what a properly drawn circuit should look like when the time came for them to take up the pencil.

Now MIT alum Star Simpson [above] is giving Mims’s work a fresh lease on life with printed circuit boards based directly on his notebooks.

It’s unsurprising, given the long partnership between the German electronic art-rocker band and the moving image. Founded in 1967, Tangerine Dream wrote their first American film score in 1977, for William Friedkin’s thriller Sorcerer, after Friedkin begged them to consider scoring. The band, known for their knotty psychedelic electronic music, were not the most obvious choice to cross over into the mainstream, but their Prussian bandleader Edgar Froese had a lifelong interest in film, and the group’s pulsating paranoid krautrock was a perfect fit for the ticking-bomb nightmare world of Sorcerer. That film begat more scores — Michael Mann’s’s icy crime ballet Thief, 1981 B-horror Strange Behavior, and ’80s Cold War schlocker The Soldier.

Papert’s career traversed a trio of influential movements: child development, artificial intelligence, and educational technologies. Based on his insights into children’s thinking and learning, Papert recognized that computers could be used not just to deliver information and instruction, but also to empower children to experiment, explore, and express themselves. The central tenet of his Constructionist theory of learning is that people build knowledge most effectively when they are actively engaged in constructing things in the world. As early as 1968, Papert introduced the idea that computer programming and debugging can provide children a way to think about their own thinking and learn about their own learning.

<DD>Robert “Bob” Fano, a professor emeritus in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) whose work helped usher in the personal computing age, died in Naples, Florida on July 13. He was 98.

During his time on the faculty at MIT, Fano conducted research across multiple disciplines, including information theory, networks, electrical engineering and radar technologies. His work on “time-sharing” — systems that allow multiple people to use a computer at the same time — helped pave the way for the more widespread use of computers in society.

Much of his early work in information theory has directly impacted modern technologies. His research with Claude Shannon, for example, spurred data-compression techniques like Huffman coding that are used in today’s high-definition TVs and computer networks.

Strong evidence of this effect occur in the days following 911 when many ships remained in port and the ocean noise levels along the north American eastern seaboard dropped. The levels of stress hormones (cortisol) in right whale feces dropped by orders of magnitude at the same time (Rolland et al 2012).

<DD>An effective method for filtering high frequency power supply noise and cleanly sharing similar voltage supply rails (that is, analog and digital rails for mixed-signal ICs) while preserving high frequency isolation between the shared rails is the use of ferrite beads. A ferrite bead is a passive device that filters high frequency noise energy over a broad frequency range. It becomes resistive over its intended frequency range and dissipates the noise energy in the form of heat. The ferrite bead is connected in series with the power supply rail and is often combined with capacitors to ground on either side of the bead. This forms a low-pass filter network, further reducing the high frequency power supply noise.

<DD>Vision is one of the most exciting senses you can endow on your robot. The ability to perceive obstacles allows a robot to make an educated decision regarding further movements.

However, it is also not the easiest senses to implement for a few reasons. Firstly, vision can be abstracted to a two-dimensional vector when it comes to computing, as opposed to a single dimensional scalar such as, say, temperature. Secondly, it is an analog value like many other senses, so it requires a certain degree of digitization and processing for it to make sense to a computer. Finally, though this is not strictly a problem, is visualization. Vision data cannot be represented as mere numbers to humans. Although that is how computers process data, it makes no sense for a human to decode digits. However, with the help of modern technology, and basic knowledge of physics and math, we will be able to endow our robot with the gift of sight!

Sadier had met Gane at a McCarthy gig in Paris, and she’d been a member of the group in its final days. When they decided to start making music together again, Stereolab was born: a multi-limbed musical collective unafraid of the joys of pop melody but equally comfortable with wild experimentation.

<DD>A man in Cambridge, England has built what he calls a "megaprocessor" in his living room. It's 32-feet wide, six and a half feet tall, and so far he uses it to play Tetris.

James Newman, the megaproccessor's creator and owner, explains on his website:

"Like all modern processors the Megaprocessor is built from transistors. It's just that instead of using teeny-weeny ones integrated on a silicon chip it uses discrete individual ones like those below. Thousands of them. And loads of LEDs."

The project took Newman three years, which he tracked on his website. Newman has built, among other things, a 16-bit processor, and in February he finally figured out what his first programs would be: "Tetris, noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe) and Life."

When the first Corona spy satellites were launched in the early 1960s, resolution was laughable compared to today's standards. One pixel comprised 40 feet, making it difficult to see anything much smaller than a bus. And that bus would look like a blurry dot.

Technicians continued to improve upon the lens and film. By 1968, resolution was down to 6 feet per pixel, but it was meaningless if the camera wasn't perfectly focused.

<DD>A connectome is a comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain, and may be thought of as its "wiring diagram". More broadly, a connectome would include the mapping of all neural connections within an organism's nervous system.
Rendering of a group connectome based on 20 subjects. Anatomical fibers that constitute the white matter architecture of the human brain are visulized color-coded by traversing direction (xyz-directions mapping to rgb colors respectively). Visualization of fibers was done using TrackVis software.

The production and study of connectomes, known as connectomics, may range in scale from a detailed map of the full set of neurons and synapses within part or all of the nervous system of an organism to a macro scale description of the functional and structural connectivity between all cortical areas and subcortical structures. The term "connectome" is used primarily in scientific efforts to capture, map, and understand the organization of neural interactions within the brain.

Research has successfully constructed the full connectome of one animal: the roundworm C. elegans (White et al., 1986, Varshney et al., 2011). Partial connectomes of a mouse retina and mouse primary visual cortex have also been successfully constructed. Bock et al.'s complete 12 TB data set is publicly available at Open Connectome Project.

<DD>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to "a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness."

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an "extrovert ideal" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts. Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.

<DD>On the far reaches of Brooklyn’s Atlantic coastline is a forgotten piece of aviation history.

Long before JFK and LaGuardia, there was Floyd Bennett Field, New York City’s first municipal airport. Designed in stunning Art Deco style, it was once the most modern airport in the world, a glittering gateway into America’s principal metropolis. Many of the leading aviators of their day started daring adventures here during the golden age of aviation—pilots like Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh and Roscoe Turner, the latter of whom flew with a lion cub as his co-pilot. Wiley Post, the man who was the first to fly solo around the world, took off and landed here in front of crowds of 50,000 fans. When Howard Hughes set the world record for flying fastest around the world, it was from Floyd Bennett that he piloted his gleaming Lockheed Super Electra.

But today many of the old hangars lie empty and abandoned. The deserted control tower looks over runways covered in weeds.  I went to explore the airfield to discover its incredible history, uncovering a remarkable hidden treasure along the way—a graveyard of vintage planes being tended to by a dedicated group of volunteers.

It’s been so positive, in fact, that we’re actively looking for more high-caliber Toronto founders to fund. The city has all the markings of a world-class hub for technology startups and reminds me a lot of how New York City felt in the early 2000s when I moved back from the Bay Area — simmering with entrepreneurial talent, opportunity and a strong foundation to support it. I think Toronto is poised to contend as one of the biggest North American hubs for technology startup activity over the next five-10 years.

<DD>We are all faced with problems to solve in our workday. There are many problem-solving methods, and the six-step method is just one of them. The problem for most people is that they do not use one process to solve problems and issues or to make decisions. Another problem is that people are not consistent in how they solve problems. They do not find something that works and then do it the same way over and over to be successful.

<DD>Terrapattern is the first open-access search tool for satellite imagery. Choose something that catches your eye—a dish farm, a gravel pit, a traffic circle—and Terrapattern will find other things that look like dishes, pits, or circles, pinpoint them on a map, and serve them up as a downloadable set of G.P.S. coördinates. (One of Levin’s friends, a skateboarder, is already using the site to locate empty swimming pools.) Terrapattern was designed by a small team, including Levin, several of his students, the artist Kyle McDonald, and the developer David Newbury. It is intended as a prototype. “Our budget, in terms of the computing power we can afford, makes about twenty-five hundred square miles of the American landscape searchable,” Levin said. For the moment, Terrapattern is limited to Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and New York. According to Newbury, it seems to have a particular gift for finding marinas and bridges.

<DD>A little more than five years ago, a previously unused Reddit account began posting seemingly random strings of numbers and text in a new subreddit it had created. To the casual eye, there wasn’t much to see. The subreddit shared the same inscrutable set of numbers and letters as its moderator; the sidebar and comments provided no clarifying information.

If it was a mystery, it appeared a banal one. Like any number of niche subreddits, it seemed to serve some unknown, private purpose. Whoever was using it had no interest in drawing attention, and so it remained ignored and forgotten, letters and numbers quietly churning away in a overlooked corner of the web.

It’s not clear how the larger Reddit community discovered r/A858DE45F56D9BC9—whether by chance or through subtle hints—but soon enough, redditors saw those strings of letters and numbers and decided they looked like a code. And if it was a code, the online sleuths would set out to crack it.

<DD>Easter eggs have grown into big business. Every version of Windows usually contains at least three hidden messages that can be accessed using certain key presses or mouse actions. Easter Eggs are usually intended as a joke or, in many cases to communicate the programmer's feelings at the time. The first documented case involves an Atari programmer who placed his name into a hidden section of the game.

The phenomena found its way into several Commodore machines. If you type SYS 32800,123,45,6 on a C128 you get a hidden message. It quickly spread to the Amiga, providing a glimpse at the authors feelings at the time.

An ever-growing, dirty, noisy traffic chaos. The bike is a great tool for change, but the powerful interests who gain from the private car invest billions each year on lobbying and advertising to protect their business.

<DD>Welcome to liblfds, a portable, license-free, lock-free data structure library written in C.

Lock-free data structures are process, thread and interrupt safe (i.e. the same data structure instance can be safely used across processes, threads and both inside and outside of interrupt handlers), never sleep (and so are safe for kernel use when sleeping is not permitted), operate without context switches, cannot fail (no need to handle error cases, as there are none), perform and scale literally orders of magnitude better than locking data structures, and liblfds itself (as of release 7.0.0) is implemented such that it performs no allocations and compiles not just on a freestanding C89 implementation, but on a bare C89 implementation.

<DD>You might have seen my discrete 555 and 741 IC electronics kits. Well, a while back I had this idea about creating a discrete version of a microprocessor, but it just sounded too difficult, time consuming, or impractical. And part of me didn’t want to do it, because it just sounds so tedious to design–at every stage, I was secretly hoping to find a show-stopping problem. But part of me was really interested to see if it could be done.

At dinner, Windell and I went through a thought experiment to see if it would even be possible. We weren’t sure how many transistors were in a 6502 (more than 1,000 but less than 10,000). If four surface mount transistors can fit in a square centimeter, then the board would need to be about 1,000 square centimeters, or about 32cm (13in) on a side, which is not as huge as we originally thought. Darn it, time to investigate further!

<DD>The title sequence for HBO’s Silicon Valley is by far the most efficiently entertaining thing on television. In its scant 10 seconds, it manages to be at once satire, in-joke, and charter of tech culture’s shifting corporate landscape—while packing the screen with blink-and-you’ll-miss-it sight gags. And just like the world it lampoons, the sequence is always changing: each new season has brought with it a new version with a new crop of easter eggs.

Yet somehow, it started as an afterthought. When co-creator Mike Judge was working on the pilot in 2013, he tells WIRED, it wasn’t until late in the editing process that somebody reminded him that the episode needed titles. “I was actually relieved to hear that we only had about 10 seconds,” he says, “because I thought I needed that time.”

<DD>The IV Swinger is an IV curve tracer for photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. I built it for my friend Professor Gil Masters to use in the lab for his CEE176B course at Stanford (“Electric Power: Renewables and Efficiency”). It was used in the Spring 2015 and 2016 CEE176B labs. It was also used by the Stanford Solar Car project in 2015.

An IV curve plots the current and voltage generated by a PV panel for different load resistances ranging from short circuit to open circuit. The point on this curve that has the largest V * I product is the maximum power point (MPP). The shape of the IV curve and the MPP for a PV panel depend on factors such as its temperature and the intensity and uniformity of the sunlight falling on its surface.

At the time, there was a dearth of decent beginner electronics books. Publishers like TAB meant well, but they had production budgets too low to manage decent photography and illustration, respectable copy editing, and they had electrical engineers writing their books who should probably have just stuck with the soldering and circuit testing.

<DD>Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking is a 2012 non-fiction book written by Susan Cain. Cain argues that modern Western culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of introverted people, leading to "a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness."

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an "extrovert ideal" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, Quiet outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century. Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both...

<DD>The reality we live in is that “Senior Developer” means a person who has been slinging code for more than 3 years. These people are put into leadership positions, and typically things play out as you would expect — quite badly.

This is my take on the terms we use in the industry. Really, putting people into 3 buckets is a huge over-simplification of the nuance, knowledge, and experience of progressing through this profession, but it is what it is. If we are going to classify people in this way, then we need to take time in the industry off the table. A person with 10 years experience is quite different than someone who has experienced the same year 10 times.

<DD>Take a look at any job board and you’ll see a slew of profiles and listings with the title “Senior Developer” in them. But what exactly makes this employee Senior? Usually, someone with this word in their job title has been in their field for a certain amount of time or has a specific amount of work experience. So we were a little shocked when 30% of developers we surveyed that identified as a “Senior Developer” were in their 20s. We assume that for many people, seniority is more about expertise within a topic and scope of responsibility, not just pure years of experience.

While doing further research, it became apparent that the topic is highly debated among technical hiring managers and developers alike (like this thread on the Programmers Stack Exchange). Some companies (like us here at Stack Overflow) don’t believe in using the title within our engineering team.

Here are a few of the common responses we found when we asked: “What defines a senior developer?”

<DD>Some workplace questions are difficult to answer, but this one is not: Why do employees quit their jobs?

They do it because they are undervalued. They leave their jobs because they are kept in the dark and unappreciated. The biggest problem most managers have is that they neglect their employees.

They say to themselves, “No one has complained to me about anything, so everything must be fine in my department” when it isn’t. Their employees have tried to say, “I have a concern — there’s something we need to talk about” but their issues were brushed aside.

Strong managers are constantly asking their teammates, “How are you doing? How are you holding up?” Weak managers don’t ask, because they don’t want to hear the answer. If they tuned in and listened to their employees, they’d be responsible for taking a step. They might have to advocate for a team member. That’s what they don’t want to do.

Here are 10 unmistakable signs some or all of your employees are looking for a job that doesn’t put them in daily contact with you. Now is your chance to step up and ask your employees what you can do to make your workplace a human place where people can thrive and grow.

Don’t wait for these signs to show themselves — do it now!

<DD>Passwords fail. Human memory is weak, so we pick familiar terms. To avoid familiar terms, logins require long passwords, with numbers and capitalization and special characters. Humans forget these, because they’re complicated, and so they have to answer security questions, which are things familiar to the person, and therefore discoverable. The greatest failure in online security is often fallible memory. Researchers from Perceptual User Interfaces have a better idea, located inside people’s heads. It uses the unique sounds their skulls make.

<DD>The von Neumann architecture, also known as the von Neumann model and Princeton architecture, is a computer architecture based on that described in 1945 by the mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC. This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of a processing unit containing an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers, a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter, a memory to store both data and instructions, external mass storage, and input and output mechanisms. The meaning has evolved to be any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system.

<DD>The MANIAC (Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator, and Computer or Mathematical Analyzer, Numerator, Integrator, and Computer) was an early computer built under the direction of Nicholas Metropolis at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. It was based on the von Neumann architecture of the IAS, developed by John von Neumann. As with all computers of its era, it was a one of a kind machine that could not exchange programs with other computers (even other IAS machines). Metropolis chose the name MANIAC in the hope of stopping the rash of silly acronyms for machine names, although von Neumann may have suggested the name to him.

<DD>The striking thing about Motor Trend‘s piece on the rumored Apple car is all the talk of the “user experience.”

The various auto designers and experts interviewed by Motor Trend speculate that Apple will try to redefine the car “experience.” They talk about stuff like acoustics, and look and feel, rather than specs like miles per gallon or engine torque.

They predict that Apple will bring a better “user experience” to the car of the future, not just a better physical product.

This reminded me of interviewing Apple’s designers for my Jony Ive book. They explained that the design group takes exactly this approach when thinking about new Apple products. Instead of starting with chip speeds or screen resolutions, they begin by asking each other how the new product should make the user feel.

And thinking about this made me realize why Jony Ive has a chauffeur. It’s not because he’s a one percenter. It’s about Project Titan, Apple’s future car.

I also asked around and Fitbit seemed like the most "open" platform for collecting one's own data. You have to pay $50 for a premium account, but after that, they allow you to download your data. Or do they? I looked into the details, asked a buddy or two, and found out that you actually can't get the really interesting minute-by-minute data even with a premium account. You only get the daily summarized totals for steps/calories/stairs climbed. While this data is of some value, the minute-by-minute data are oh so much more interesting. I'd like to use it for personal interest, for teaching, for research, and for sharing interesting new ideas back to other Fitbit developers.

<DD>
Their Secret? Polyrhythms.

A rhythm is the reoccurrence of a beat, and a polyrhythm is the combination of two or more rhythms. But here is the clever bit: in a polyrhythm, one reoccurring rhythm should not derive from the other! For example, 3 evenly-spaced beats against 2, 4-against-3, and 5-against-3 are common polyrhythms, but 4-against-2 is not, because two divides four.

Assuming each individual drummer plays a simple reoccurring beat, a complex polyrhythmic pattern will emerge from the group as a whole. This is what our generator simulates online.

Polyrhythms are the generating principle behind many sub-Saharan African music styles. By constantly balancing the listener's attention between the individual beats and the ever-changing resulting pattern, polyrhythms offer a strong hypnotic character and can induce a trance after a prolonged period of listening.

<DD>Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a theory in psychology proposed by Abraham Maslow in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in Psychological Review.[2] Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human developmental psychology, some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. Maslow used the terms "physiological", "safety", "belongingness" and "love", "esteem", "self-actualization", and "self-transcendence" to describe the pattern that human motivations generally move through.

<DD>In our FlaschenTaschen project, there are a lot of LEDs - in sum using a lot of current. In total we need about 90 Ampere at 5 Volt, provided by three power supplies (each about 30A). For such high currents, it is a good idea to make sure that there can not be a condition in which cables melt or power supplies let out the magic smoke.

Thus, for each of the nine crate columns, we have a separately fused supply cable, carrying the load of 10 Ampere. We are using commonly available car blade fuses for this. For our first quick prototype we just got a cheap fuse from the Dollar-store across the street (a set with ten fuses). But is this a good choice ?

Testing before things blow up in production is your friend. We got three different kind of fuses - the Dollar store version, some somewhat cheap assortment via EBay, and fuses from a company that is making fuses as their main objective.

Essentially a "fake" mobile tower acting between the target mobile phone and the service provider's real towers, it is considered a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. IMSI-catchers are used in some countries by law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but their use has raised significant civil liberty and privacy concerns and is strictly regulated in some countries such as under the German Strafprozessordnung (German) (StPO / Code of Criminal Procedure).[1] Some countries do not even have encrypted phone data traffic (or very weak encryption), thus rendering an IMSI-catcher unnecessary.

<DD>Before the iPod, the Sony Walkman or the home stereo system, music was something people made and experienced with other people.

The universal nature of music-making, which occurs in every culture throughout the ages, suggests evolution may have wired us for it, and that the survival benefit it confers has something to do with the way social groups cohere. But such ideas are speculative and the social dimension of music remains largely unexplored.

Now, researchers at McMaster University in Hamilton are aiming to change that with an $8-million facility unique in the world. The novel laboratory they’ve created will explore the interactive side of music-making with an unprecedented rigour – and it will serve as a tool for a wide range of other research applications from engineering better hearing aids to optimizing presentations to better hold an audience’s attention.

That night, I decided to take it easy, as I had to bike my way home, and would more than likely encounter my parents, who were not fans of the underaged drinking scene. With that in mind, I stopped after a few drinks, and decided to finish out the evening's festivities with a glass of orange juice. I drank it down, hit the bathroom, chatted with a few friends for about 20 minutes, and then made my way to the door...where I froze. Something was definitely not right, and I wasn't sure what it was. A sinking feeling of dread slowly grew in my stomach as I tried to figure out where my head was at, but the more I concentrated, the more confused I got. Turning slowly back to the kitchen, I met the eye of a guy I knew to be a pretty habitual acidhead.

Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.

Sodium supports a variety of compilers and operating systems, including Windows (with MinGW or Visual Studio, x86 and x86_64), iOS and Android.

The design choices emphasize security, and "magic constants" have clear rationales.

And despite the emphasis on high security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

<DD>Andy Grove, the former Intel Corp. chief executive whose youth under Nazi occupation and escape from the Iron Curtain inspired an "only the paranoid survive" management philosophy that saved the chip maker from financial ruin in the 1980s, has died. He was 79.

Intel said Grove died on Monday. It did not specify a cause of death.

Grove, who was instrumental in building Intel into the world's largest chip company during his 37-year career there, had suffered from Parkinson's disease. He also suffered from prostate cancer in the mid-1990s.

He was a mercurial but visionary leader who helped position Intel's microprocessors as the central technology inside personal computers.

<DD>At The Secrets of Radar Museum we ask you to imagine keeping a secret for 50 years.  Could you do it? 

Thousands of Canadian men and women who served in radar during World War II did just that.  They took their oath of secrecy to heart, keeping the truth from family and friends, many taking their service history to the grave before the Official Secrets Act expired in 1991.  They were radar mechanics, operators, teachers, trainers, physicists, and researchers.  Their actions, deeds, and experiences went unknown and unrecorded when many of the most important histories of WWII were being written. 

The Secrets of Radar Museum preserves their history through physical exhibits, a substantial research archive, and oral histories recounted by the veterans themselves.  Their legacy informs the radar history of the Cold War, which we also explore in displays and online.  Radar is a ubiquitous part of our modern lives, so pervasive that most of the time we aren't even aware of it.  We exist to remind you that regular men and women, just like you and me, affected not just the outcome of WWII, but the technological and scientific trajectory of the 20th century.  We are the only museum of this kind in Canada.

CFS Carp (nicknamed the Diefenbunker) was one of several emergency government facilities built throughout Canada. Its position as Canada's Central Emergency Government Headquarters meant that it would house the Prime Minister and Governor General in the event of a lockdown situation, and that it would coordinate communications from the regional and zonal headquarters.

<DD>Staatliches Bauhaus, commonly known simply as Bauhaus, was an art school in Germany that combined crafts and the fine arts, and was famous for the approach to design that it publicised and taught.

<DD>Paul Klee (German: [paʊ̯l ˈkleː]; 18 December 1879 – 29 June 1940) was a Swiss-German painter. His highly individual style was influenced by movements in art that included Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism. Klee was a natural draftsman who experimented with and eventually deeply explored color theory, writing about it extensively; his lectures Writings on Form and Design Theory (Schriften zur Form und Gestaltungslehre), published in English as the Paul Klee Notebooks, are held to be as important for modern art as Leonardo da Vinci's A Treatise on Painting for the Renaissance. He and his colleague, Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky, both taught at the Bauhaus school of art, design and architecture. His works reflect his dry humor and his sometimes childlike perspective, his personal moods and beliefs, and his musicality.

Jeanine was explaining that there was little chance her group was going to make the numbers for this quarter. “Honestly?” she said. “The numbers weren’t realistic to begin with. It was really unlikely that we were going to make them.” That’s when John lost it. “You agreed to the numbers in our budget meeting! You came up with them!” Jeanine was silent for a while. Then she stammered out a weak defense that John promptly tore apart. Later, when John and I were debriefing the conversation, he asked me a question that I have heard countless times from countless leaders. “How do I get my people to be more accountable for results?” Accountability is not simply taking the blame when something goes wrong. It’s not a confession. Accountability is about delivering on a commitment. It’s responsibility to an outcome, not just a set of tasks. It’s taking initiative with thoughtful, strategic follow-through.

Just looking at his phenomenal output of some 10,000 artworks tells a fairly accurate history of Modern Art, as Klee adopted, studied then discarded the ideas and forms of the twentieth century’s major artistic movements—Expressionism, Cubism, Surrealism, Abstraction and the Bauhaus school. Klee became a great artist, and was also a poet, writer, composer and musician, but he could have been just an ordinary, run-of-the-mill traditional painter had he not had a startling epiphany in his early twenties, circa 1900. He was studying painting under artist Franz von Stuck in Germany. Klee excelled at drawing but was deeply frustrated and dissatisfied by his lack of aptitude as a painter.

<DD>In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead characterize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are. Pub/sub is a sibling of the message queue paradigm, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system. Most messaging systems support both the pub/sub and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS). This pattern provides greater network scalability and a more dynamic network topology, with a resulting decreased flexibility to modify the Publisher and its structure of the data published.

<DD>MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers.

<DD>MQTT (formerly MQ Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922) publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required or the network bandwidth is limited. The publish-subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message. Andy Stanford-Clark and Arlen Nipper of Cirrus Link Solutions authored the first version of the protocol in 1999.

<DD>Scientists at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) - the UK's National Measurement Institute - have developed an optical method for remotely measuring sound pressure inside a fully anechoic chamber which is the first to provide direct traceability to the SI base units. Accurate measurements of airborne sound are needed for a range of regulatory, health and safety, and commercial applications, from monitoring environmental noise to testing the performance of acoustic devices. To ensure reliable measurements of sound pressure, microphones must be regularly calibrated by measuring their sensitivity over a certain frequency range.

<DD>Most people know about ultrasound through its role in prenatal imaging: those grainy, grey outlines of junior constructed from reflected sound waves. A new technology called an "acoustic diode," envisioned by researchers in China's Nanjing University, may dramatically improve future ultrasound images by changing the way sound waves are transmitted. In the journal Applied Physics Letters, which is produced by AIP Publishing, the scientists describe the theoretical framework for an acoustic diode—a device that achieves a one-way transmission of sound waves much the same as an electrical diode controls the one-way transmission of electrical impulses. The one-way flow of sound would provide brighter and clearer ultrasound images by eliminating acoustic disturbances caused by sound waves going in two directions at the same time and interfering with each other, explained researcher Jian-chun Cheng.

<DD>Engineers at Lincoln Laboratory led by MIT and Whirlwind alumnus Kenneth Olsen built “Transistorized eXperimental computer zero” or “Tix Oh,” the TX-0 computer, an experimental high-speed digital computer for testing transistor circuitry and very large magnetic core memory. Transistors were expensive ($30–$80 each compared with $3–$10 per tube), and TX-0 used 3,600 total. The Lincoln team soon learned the new technology was very reliable. This console features a built-in cathode-ray tube display that reveals the influence of the SAGE radar console systems. One especially notable feature was the light-pen that enabled operators to interact with programs while they are running. The very large (64K RAM!) memory, speed, and reliability of the TX-0 made it one of the most advanced computers in the world when fully operational in 1957. However, Lincoln engineers were busy building an even bigger and faster computer, the TX-2. Lincoln soon “loaned” the TX-0 to MIT’s Research Laboratory of...

He was 88. Clark trained in physics at the University of California / Berkeley and joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory in 1952. His first computer job was to test the nascent memory technology for MIT's Whirlwind, which was a vacuum tube computer for the U.S. Navy. By 1955 he co-invented the lab's TX-0 project, which built one of the first transistor computers. This set the course for Clark to influence the shape of an industry.

<DD>A remarkable feature of modern silicon electronics is its ability to remain physically invariant, almost indefinitely for practical purposes. Although this characteristic is a hallmark of applications of integrated circuits that exist today, there might be opportunities for systems that offer the opposite behavior, such as implantable devices that function for medically useful time frames but then completely disappear via resorption by the body. We report a set of materials, manufacturing schemes, device components, and theoretical design tools for a silicon-based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology that has this type of transient behavior, together with integrated sensors, actuators, power supply systems, and wireless control strategies. An implantable transient device that acts as a programmable nonantibiotic bacteriocide provides a system-level example.

I tell you all this because I want you to understand that when John Rogers says his team’s new invention is “some of our best stuff ever”, he’s not speaking lightly. Rogers has now created a line of “transient electronics”, which last for a specified amount of time before completely dissolving away.

<DD>“I just took out a bullet from the back of a guy’s head an hour ago,” says Rory Murphy. As a neurosurgeon at the Washington University School of Medicine, Murphy “deals with brain trauma all the time.” Between bullets, blunt forces, and blood clots, traumatic brain injuries kill around 50,000 people in the United States every year. These kinds of injuries often cause the brain to swell, which constricts the flow of blood and oxygen, and can lead to permanent damage. So surgeons like Murphy need reliable ways of monitoring the pressure inside their patients’ skulls. Sensors exist, but they are large, clunky, and must be removed once the patient has recovered. Together with a team of engineers, Murphy is developing a better option: a dissolvable pressure sensor. Thinner than the tip of a needle, it can be left in a patient’s brain to take accurate readings for several days, before completely disappearing. You don’t need to remove them because there’s nothing to remove.

As a significant contributor to the local and national economies, a job creator, and a facilitator for trade and foreign investment, Toronto Pearson knits Canada together and helps our country compete globally. We recognize that airports have impacts, such as noise on local communities. While airplane noise can’t be eliminated entirely, we know the community served by the airport expects us to be a good neighbour. One important way to do this is to lessen the impact of our operations on our neighbours by reducing aircraft noise where possible. NAV CANADA and the GTAA are studying six ideas we think will have benefits for the communities surrounding Toronto Pearson and we’ve been out talking about them at Stakeholder Roundtables throughout the GTA.

But her peace has fallen victim to the “screech” of jets overhead – hundreds of times a day – after changes were made to the way planes fly into Pearson International Airport. The shift moved a key approach to Pearson and condensed flight traffic over a smaller area. The result, according to Ms. Evans, a founding co-chair of the Toronto Aviation Noise Group (TANG), was that she had 86,000 planes over her area in the first year after the changes were put in place in 2012.

Fisher, Target Canada’s president, was holding these meetings every day as the launch date crept closer. The news was rarely good. The company was having trouble moving products from its cavernous distribution centres and onto store shelves, which would leave Target outlets poorly stocked. The checkout system was glitchy and didn’t process transactions properly. Worse, the technology governing inventory and sales was new to the organization; no one seemed to fully understand how it all worked.

<DD>Breaking into a run. Standing too long in once place. Repeatedly looking over your shoulder. Everyone does these things from time to time, and they aren’t usually cause for alarm. But in Esther Hovers’ series False Positives, such things are very suspicious indeed, and suggest a heinous crime may soon occur. Her images emulate the actions so-called smart cameras would deem “deviant behavior.” Connected to highly sophisticated software, these cameras can, among other things, detect abnormal activity like a person leaving a package or backpack on a busy street corner and alert the authorities. This, of course, prompts all kinds of conversations about privacy, security, and control. Hover hopes to contribute to the discussion. “[The project] aims to raise questions about deviant and normal behavior within public space,” Hovers says. “Should intelligent surveillance cameras be the judge of this?”

<DD>Physicists in Germany have used an experimental nuclear fusion device to produce hydrogen plasma in a process similar to what happens on the Sun. The test marks an important milestone on the road towards this super-futuristic source of cheap and clean nuclear energy. Earlier today in an event attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel (herself a PhD physicist), researchers from the Max Planck Institute in Greifswald turned on the Wendelstein 7-X stellarator, an experimental nuclear fusion reactor. (Actually, the researchers let Merkel do the honors.) This €400 million ($435 million) stellarator is being used by physicists to test the technical viability of a future fusion reactor.

<DD>Reality Computing encompasses the many ways data is captured from the physical world; put to use with digital tools for the creation of designs, new information, and seeing changes over time; and ultimately realized either physically (with 3D printing and digital fabrication) or visually (through augmented reality or projection technologies). For anyone engaged in the design, delivery, or management of physical things, Reality Computing is a vision for how technologies are breaking down the barriers between the physical and digital worlds. Since the advent of digital recordings and audio CDs, music enthusiasts have been copying music tracks, editing or reformatting them to suit their needs, and publishing the results for other people or other devices. Colloquially known as ‘rip, mix, and burn’, this practice completely upended the music industry. Reality Computing is the same idea for data capture, compute, and create.

But there was an interesting side point made at an AU 2015 class (RC11028: As-Built Models—Myth or Fact?) about how we almost always equate the ‘capture’ part of Reality Computing as capturing information based on sight. During the class, Casey Rutland from Arup Associates reminded the audience that reality capture can be extended to our other senses.

<DD>Edward Teller (Hungarian: Teller Ede; January 15, 1908 – September 9, 2003) was a Hungarian-born American theoretical physicist who is known colloquially as "the father of the hydrogen bomb", although he claimed he did not care for the title. He made numerous contributions to nuclear and molecular physics, spectroscopy (in particular, the Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller effects) and surface physics. His extension of Enrico Fermi's theory of beta decay, in the form of the so-called Gamow–Teller transitions, provided an important stepping stone in its application, while the Jahn–Teller effect and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) theory have retained their original formulation and are still mainstays in physics and chemistry. Teller also made contributions to Thomas–Fermi theory, the precursor of density functional theory, a standard modern tool in the quantum mechanical treatment of complex molecules. In 1953, along with Nicholas Metropolis and Marshall Rosenbluth, Teller co-authored...

<DD>A thermonuclear weapon is a nuclear weapon that uses the energy from a primary nuclear fission reaction to compress and ignite a secondary nuclear fusion reaction. The result is greatly increased explosive power when compared to single-stage fission weapons. It is colloquially referred to as a hydrogen bomb or H-bomb because it employs fusion of isotopes of hydrogen. The fission stage in such weapons is required to cause the fusion that occurs in thermonuclear weapons.

<DD>“Ostalgie” is a German portmanteau of “Ost,” meaning “East,” and “nostalgie,” meaning “nostalgia,” because yes—many former East Germans remember life under communism quite fondly, and for a variety of reasons. There’s obviously some sentimentalism regarding one’s youth, (oppressive government or not, people like to reminisce on their salad days), but there was also distinctly East German culture, community, art and aesthetics. Combine all that with low unemployment and the absence of destitute poverty, of course people will miss some aspects of the lives they led on the other side of the Wall. This is not to say there isn’t an ambivalence to Ostalgie; for example, I doubt anyone much misses the Stasi.

Even though major collisions might seem like something that only affects the distant past or remote areas—a headache for T-Rexes and Russians, but not you—the fact that more population centers haven’t been in harm’s way so far is basically down to random chance.

<DD>In philosophy, qualia (/ˈkwɑːliə/ or /ˈkweɪliə/; singular form: quale) are individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term "qualia" derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation: [ˈkwaːlis]) meaning "of what sort" or "of what kind"). Examples of qualia include the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the perceived redness of an evening sky. As qualitative characters of sensation, qualia stand in contrast to "propositional attitudes".

<DD>The SR.N4 (Saunders-Roe Nautical 4) hovercraft (also known as the Mountbatten class hovercraft) was a large passenger and vehicle carrying hovercraft built by the British Hovercraft Corporation (BHC). BHC was formed by the merger of Saunders-Roe and Vickers Supermarine in 1966. Work on the SR.N4 began in 1965 and the first trials took place in early 1968. Power was provided by four Rolls-Royce Proteus marine turboshaft engines each driving its own lift fan and pylon-mounted steerable propulsion propeller. The SR.N4 was the largest hovercraft built to that date, designed to carry 254 passengers in two cabins besides a four-lane automobile bay which held up to 30 cars. Cars were driven from a bow ramp just forward of the cockpit / wheelhouse. The first design was 40 metres (131 ft) long, weighed 190 long tons (193 t), was capable of 83 knots (154 km/h) and could cruise at over 60 knots (111 km/h). The SR.N4s operated services across the English Channel between 1968 and 2000.

Occasionally there may be a few weeks or months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.

<DD>Schizophrenia is a heritable brain illness with unknown pathogenic mechanisms. Schizophrenia’s strongest genetic association at a population level involves variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus, but the genes and molecular mechanisms accounting for this have been challenging to identify. Here we show that this association arises in part from many structurally diverse alleles of the complement component 4 (C4) genes. We found that these alleles generated widely varying levels of C4A and C4B expression in the brain, with each common C4 allele associating with schizophrenia in proportion to its tendency to generate greater expression of C4A. Human C4 protein localized to neuronal synapses, dendrites, axons, and cell bodies. In mice, C4 mediated synapse elimination during postnatal development. These results implicate excessive complement activity in the development of schizophrenia and may help explain the reduced numbers of synapses in the brains of individuals...

The message from Apple was clear: the iPod, that famously “perfect thing” that was designed to hold your music library in your pocket, no longer made sense in a world where when tens of millions of songs were now merely an app away. But for some music fans, the high cost of mobile data, and a desire to have their whole library on their person at all times, has them returning to the old standby. A quick search on eBay finds several vendors selling refurbished models of old iPods that include brand new batteries and storage drives. The drives in these refurbished models, which tend to go for around $300 to $400, are typically high-capacity solid state drives (SSDs) with as much as 256GB of space—enough for more than 50,000 songs encoded at typical bitrates.

<DD>XMODEM is a simple file transfer protocol developed as a quick hack by Ward Christensen for use in his 1977 MODEM.ASM terminal program. It allowed users to transmit files between their computers when both sides used MODEM. Keith Petersen made a minor update to always turn on "quiet mode", and called the result XMODEM.[1] XMODEM became extremely popular in the early bulletin board system (BBS) market, largely because it was so simple to implement. It was also fairly inefficient, and as modem speeds increased this problem led to the development of a number of modified versions of XMODEM to improve performance or address other problems with the protocol. Christensen believed his original XMODEM to be "the single most modified program in computing history".[2] Chuck Forsberg collected a number of modifications into his YMODEM protocol, but poor implementation led to a further fracturing before they were re-unified by his later ZMODEM protocol.

<DD>ZMODEM is a file transfer protocol developed by Chuck Forsberg in 1986, in a project funded by Telenet in order to improve file transfers on their X.25 network. In addition to dramatically improved performance compared to older protocols, ZMODEM also offered restartable transfers, auto-start by the sender, an expanded 32-bit CRC, and control character quoting, allowing it to be used on networks that might "eat" control characters. ZMODEM became extremely popular on bulletin board systems (BBS) in the early 1990s, displacing earlier protocols such as XMODEM and YMODEM. The key improvement in ZMODEM was the introduction of sliding window support for improved performance. Generally file transfer protocols break down a file into a series of packets, and then send them one-at-a-time to the receiver. If the packet is received correctly an ACK message is sent and the sender then starts sending the next packet.

<DD>YMODEM is a file transfer protocol used between microcomputers connected together using modems. YMODEM was developed by Chuck Forsberg as the successor to XMODEM and MODEM7, and was first implemented in his CP/M YAM program. It was formally given the name "YMODEM" in 1985 by Ward Christensen. The original YMODEM was essentially the same as XMODEM except that it sent the file's name, size, and timestamp in a regular XMODEM block, "block 0", before actually transferring the file. Sending the file size solved XMODEM's problem of superfluous padding at the end of the file.

<DD>Chuck Forsberg (May 6, 1944 – September 24, 2015) developed two data transmission protocols popular for uploading and downloading files from dial-up bulletin board systems in the 1990s. He received a Dvorak Award for Excellence in Telecommunications in 1992 for developing ZMODEM. He was also the project engineer on the Tektronix 4010-series graphics terminals. The widely adopted ZMODEM used a sliding window protocol. Rather than wait for positive acknowledgment after each block is sent, it sent blocks in rapid succession and resent unacknowledged blocks later. By avoiding delays due to latency, the bandwidth usable for transmission more closely approached the bandwidth of the underlying link. ZMODEM could also resume interrupted transfers without retransmitting the already-received blocks. In addition to developing the protocol, Forsberg developed software for sending and receiving files using ZMODEM. Previously, he designed the YMODEM protocol and created its first...

Some made their marks quietly, with little fanfare. Others garnered headlines and worldwide attention. And although each left his or her own unique legacy, they all shared a pioneering spirit that brought them to the forefront of their respective disciplines and industries. So as the calendar turns to 2016, we take a moment to remember some of the great technology minds we lost in 2015.

<DD>This is my slowly evolving SCELBI/8008 emulation app. It currently only runs on Macintosh OS/X. I also have a start on an IOS/iPAD port of this program. Major parts of it are working in the xcode IOS simulator. However, I don't know if I want to spend the $100 to become an official IOS developer, so I can test it on a real IOS device. I also wrote an 8008 Unix POSIX style 8008 emulator/debugger in order to debug 8008 programs. If you need a simple 8008 emulator/debugger, send me an email and I'll send you the latest source. Support for any of these programs should be expected to be the same as the amount of money that you pay for it. You can feel free to send me an email if you think of an improvement or find a bug, but I may not act on it for days, weeks, months or years, if ever.

<DD>Chemo, for some reason, enables me to recall incidents from long, long ago in extreme clarity. Last Tuesday as I was sitting there “getting it” I remembered riding on Volks Railway. When I was about six we lived in a small town called Portslade. Portslade is about 7 miles west of Brighton, which is 52 miles due south of London. Because I was very sick I spent a lot of time with my father’s parents. When Grandad Phillips had earned a little extra money from working overtime Grandad and Granny Phillips, after lunch on Sundays, would take me on outing. One of the best “outings” was to take a ride on the Volks railway in Brighton. Hands up those of you who have ever heard of it. Hmmm, not many.

<DD>The Voynich manuscript is an illustrated codex hand-written in an unknown writing system. The vellum on which it is written has been carbon-dated to the early 15th century (1404–1438), and it may have been composed in Northern Italy during the Italian Renaissance. The manuscript is named after Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish book dealer who purchased it in 1912. Some of the pages are missing, with around 240 still remaining. The text is written from left to right, and most of the pages have illustrations or diagrams. The Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. No one has yet succeeded in deciphering the text, and it has become a famous case in the history of cryptography. The mystery of the meaning and origin of the manuscript has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript the subject of novels and speculation. None of the many hypo...

To this day it remains one of the most popular posts we’ve ever done, the degree of interest in this peculiar, fantastical volume of fanciful schematics, all in an invented language and alphabet, was quite stunning. Similarly, The Voynich Manuscript, which dates from the early 15th century, is also written in an alphabet that nobody can decipher. The Codex Seraphinianus was written in the 20th century by a writer who is still among us, but the Voynich Manuscript isn’t like that. For centuries a great many people have tried to crack its elusive code, but nobody has been able to. So you get a very similar effect, marvelous illustrations of botanical fantasies, tagged with captions we can’t comprehend.

<DD>Imagine losing control over everything. You can't move on your own. You can't scratch an itch. And worse still, you can't tell anyone around you that you have an itch. You can feel pain, hunger, loneliness, and fear, but you can't react to those sensations. You are totally aware of your surroundings, but you can't communicate your feelings or desires, or even your basic needs. The term for this horror is locked-in syndrome. Someone with locked-in syndrome suffers from paralysis of all voluntary muscles except for those that move the eyes. This can be caused by neurological disease such as ALS, strokes, injuries to the brain stem, or drug overdose. The term locked-in syndrome has only been in use since the 1960s. Before that, people who suffered such traumatic injuries generally died from them, or else they were considered to be brain damaged. Here are the stories of eight people who have lived this nightmare.

<DD>Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep, REMS) is a unique phase of mammalian sleep characterized by random movement of the eyes, low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly. This phase is also known as paradoxical sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep because of physiological similarities to waking states, including rapid, low-voltage desynchronized brain waves. Electrical and chemical activity regulating this phase seems to originate in the brain stem and is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of monoamine neurotransmitters histamine, serotonin, and norepinepherine. The cortical and thalamic neurons of the waking or paradoxically sleeping brain are more depolarized—i.e., can "fire" more readily—than in the deeply sleeping brain. The right and left hemispheres of the brain are more coherent in REM sleep, especially during lucid dreams.

<DD>The cerebral cortex is the cerebrum's (brain) outer layer of neural tissue in humans and other mammals. It is divided into two cortices, along the sagittal plane: the left and right cerebral hemispheres divided by the medial longitudinal fissure. The cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. The human cerebral cortex is 2 to 4 millimetres (0.079 to 0.157 in) thick. In large mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded, giving a much greater surface area in the confined volume of the skull. A fold or ridge in the cortex is termed a gyrus (plural gyri) and a groove or fissure is termed a sulcus (plural sulci). In the human brain more than two-thirds of the cerebral cortex is buried in the sulci.

<DD>The occipital lobe is one of the four major lobes of the cerebral cortex in the brain of mammals. The occipital lobe is the visual processing center of the mammalian brain containing most of the anatomical region of the visual cortex. The primary visual cortex is Brodmann area 17, commonly called V1 (visual one). Human V1 is located on the medial side of the occipital lobe within the calcarine sulcus; the full extent of V1 often continues onto the posterior pole of the occipital lobe. V1 is often also called striate cortex because it can be identified by a large stripe of myelin, the Stria of Gennari. Visually driven regions outside V1 are called extrastriate cortex. There are many extrastriate regions, and these are specialized for different visual tasks, such as visuospatial processing, color differentiation, and motion perception. The name derives from the overlying occipital bone, which is named from the Latin ob, behind, and caput, the head. Bilateral lesions of the occipital...

<DD>Alpha waves are neural oscillations in the frequency range of 7.5–12.5 Hz arising from synchronous and coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in humans. They are also called Berger's wave in memory of the founder of EEG. Alpha waves are one type of brain waves detected either by electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG) and predominantly originate from the occipital lobe during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. Alpha waves are reduced with open eyes, drowsiness and sleep. Historically, they were thought to represent the activity of the visual cortex in an idle state. More recent papers have argued that they inhibit areas of the cortex not in use, or alternatively that they play an active role in network coordination and communication. Occipital alpha waves during periods of eyes closed are the strongest EEG brain signals.

It can typically be visualized as a "brief oscillation" like one might see recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be combined, using a "reverse, shift, multiply and integrate" technique called convolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the unknown signal.

<DD>Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in such a way that the first principal component has the largest possible variance (that is, accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the preceding components. The resulting vectors are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. The principal components are orthogonal because they are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which is symmetric. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

<DD>ITIL, formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library, is a set of practices for IT Service Management (ITSM) that focuses on aligning IT services with the needs of business. In its current form (known as ITIL 2011 edition), ITIL is published as a series of five core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage. Although ITIL underpins ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS15000), the International Service Management Standard for IT service management, there are some differences between the ISO 20000 standard and the ITIL framework. ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are not organization-specific, but can be applied by an organization for establishing integration with the organization's strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvement.

<DD>In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, they play a central role in cell-to-cell communication. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin.[a] Action potentials in neurons are also known as "nerve impulses" or "spikes", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "spike train". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to "fire".

<DD>Neurotrophins are a family of proteins that induce the survival, development, and function of neurons. They belong to a class of growth factors, secreted proteins that are capable of signaling particular cells to survive, differentiate, or grow. Growth factors such as neurotrophins that promote the survival of neurons are known as neurotrophic factors. Neurotrophic factors are secreted by target tissue and act by preventing the associated neuron from initiating programmed cell death - thus allowing the neurons to survive. Neurotrophins also induce differentiation of progenitor cells, to form neurons. Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain (for example, the hippocampus) retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells,[citation needed] a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis.

It consists of a small, hollow glass cone attached to several electrically conductive gold wires. The term neurotrophic means "relating to the nutrition and maintenance of nerve tissue" and the device gets its name from the fact that it is coated with Matrigel and nerve growth factor to encourage the expansion of neurites through its tip. It was invented by neurologist Dr. Philip Kennedy and was successfully implanted for the first time in a human patient in 1996 by neurosurgeon Roy Bakay.

<DD>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a directed graph (or digraph) is a graph, or set of vertices connected by edges, where the edges have a direction associated with them. In formal terms, a directed graph is an ordered pair G = (V, A) (sometimes G = (V, E)) where: V is a set whose elements are called vertices, nodes, or points; A is a set of ordered pairs of vertices, called arrows, directed edges (sometimes simply edges with the corresponding set named E instead of A), directed arcs, or directed lines. It differs from an ordinary or undirected graph, in that the latter is defined in terms of unordered pairs of vertices, which are usually called edges, arcs, or lines.

<DD>Neural tissue simulation extends requirements and constraints of previous neuronal and neural circuit simulation methods, creating a tissue coordinate system. We have developed a novel tissue volume decomposition, and a hybrid branched cable equation solver. The decomposition divides the simulation into regular tissue blocks and distributes them on a parallel multithreaded machine. The solver computes neurons that have been divided arbitrarily across blocks. We demonstrate thread, strong, and weak scaling of our approach on a machine with more than 4000 nodes and up to four threads per node. Scaling synapses to physiological numbers had little effect on performance, since our decomposition approach generates synapses that are almost always computed locally. The largest simulation included in our scaling results comprised 1 million neurons, 1 billion compartments, and 10 billion conductance-based synapses and gap junctions.

<DD>Rockers, leather boys or Ton-up boys are members of a biker subculture that originated in the United Kingdom during the 1950s. It was mainly centred on British café racer[citation needed] motorcycles and rock 'n' roll music. By 1965, the term greaser had also been introduced to Great Britain and, since then, the terms greaser and rocker have become synonymous within the British Isles although used differently in North America and elsewhere. Rockers were also derisively known as Coffee Bar Cowboys. Their Japanese equivalent was called the Kaminari-zoku (Thunder Tribe).

<DD>The mod revival was a music genre and subculture that started in England in 1978 and later spread to other countries (to a lesser degree). The mod revival's mainstream popularity was relatively short, although its influence has lasted for decades. The mod revival post-dated a Teddy Boy revival, and mod revivalists sometimes clashed with Teddy Boy revivalists, skinhead revivalists, casuals, punks and rival gang members. The late 1970s mod revival was led by the band The Jam, who had adopted a stark mod look and mixed the energy of punk with the sound of 1960s mod bands. The mod revival was a conscious effort to harken back to an earlier generation in terms of style. In the early 1980s in the UK, a mod revival scene influenced by the original 1960s mod subculture developed.

<DD>A moral panic is a feeling of fear spread among a large number of people that some evil threatens the well-being of society. A Dictionary of Sociology defines a moral panic as "the process of arousing social concern over an issue - usually the work of moral entrepreneurs and the mass media." The media are key players in the dissemination of moral indignation, even when they do not appear to be consciously engaged in crusading or muckraking. Simply reporting the facts can be enough to generate concern, anxiety or panic. Examples include the belief in widespread abduction of children by predatory pedophiles, belief in ritual abuse by satanic cults of women and children, scaremongering of the spread of AIDS, and the War on Drugs. The term first appeared in the English language in 1830 in a number of Christian journals.

<DD>The mods and rockers were two conflicting British youth subcultures of the early to mid-1960s and 1970s. Media coverage of mods and rockers fighting in 1964 sparked a moral panic about British youths, and the two groups became labelled as folk devils. The rocker subculture was centred on motorcycling, and their appearance reflected that. Rockers generally wore protective clothing such as black leather jackets and motorcycle boots (although they sometimes wore brothel creeper shoes). The common rocker hairstyle was a pompadour, while their music genre of choice was 1950s rock and roll, played by artists like Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and Bo Diddley. The mod subculture was centred on fashion and music, and many mods rode scooters. Mods wore suits and other cleancut outfits, and preferred 1960s music genres such as soul, rhythm and blues, ska, beat music, and British blues-rooted bands like The Who, The Yardbirds, and The Small Faces.

<DD>Mod is a subculture that began in 1960s Britain and spread, in varying degrees, to other countries and continues today on a smaller scale. Focused on music and fashion, the subculture has its roots in a small group of London-based stylish young men in the late 1950s who were termed modernists because they listened to modern jazz, although the subculture expanded to include women. Significant elements of the mod subculture include fashion (often tailor-made suits); music (including soul, ska, and R&B); and motor scooters (usually Lambretta or Vespa). The original mod scene was associated with amphetamine-fuelled all-night dancing at clubs.

In the late 1970s, the 2 Tone ska revival in England saw the terms rude boy and rude girl, among other variations, being used to describe fans of that genre. This use of the word moved into the more contemporary Ska Punk movement as well. Now in the United Kingdom, the terms rude boy and rude girl are used in a similar way to gangsta or badman.

<DD>A skinhead is a member of a subculture that originated among working class youths in London, England, in the 1960s and then soon spread to other parts of the United Kingdom, and later to other countries around the world. Named for their close-cropped or shaven heads, the first skinheads were greatly influenced by West Indian (specifically Jamaican) rude boys and British mods, in terms of fashion, music and lifestyle. Originally, the skinhead subculture was mainly based on those elements, not politics or race. Eventually, political affiliations grew in significance for the skinhead subculture, and then the political spectrum within the subculture spanned from far right to far left, although many skinheads described themselves as apolitical. Contemporary skinhead fashions range from clean-cut 1960s mod-influenced styles to less-strict punk- and hardcore-influenced styles.

Instead of simply trying to fix faulty dopamine cells (part of what causes Parkinson’s), he wants to replace them altogether, using lab-grown stem cells. He’s won a MacArthur Genius Grant — a cool $625,000 cash prize — and, aside from genius, fellow researchers describe him as “top notch” and “the gold standard.” Dr. Oren Levy, a neurologist focusing on movement disorders like Parkinson’s, calls Studer’s work “phenomenal and groundbreaking,”...

<DD>In physics, special relativity (SR, also known as the special theory of relativity or STR) is the generally accepted and experimentally well confirmed physical theory regarding the relationship between space and time. In Einstein's original pedagogical treatment, it is based on two postulates: (1) that the laws of physics are invariant (i.e. identical) in all inertial systems (non-accelerating frames of reference); and (2) that the speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source. It was originally proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein in the paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies". The inconsistency of Newtonian mechanics with Maxwell’s equations of electromagnetism and the inability to discover Earth's motion through a luminiferous aether led to the development of special relativity, which corrects mechanics to handle situations involving motions nearing the speed of light. As of today, special relativity is the most...

<DD>A physical constant is a physical quantity that is generally believed to be both universal in nature and constant in time. It can be contrasted with a mathematical constant, which is a fixed numerical value, but does not directly involve any physical measurement. There are many physical constants in science, some of the most widely recognized being the speed of light in vacuum c, the gravitational constant G, Planck's constant h, the electric constant ε0, and the elementary charge e. Physical constants can take many dimensional forms: the speed of light signifies a maximum speed limit of the Universe and is expressed dimensionally as length divided by time; while the fine-structure constant α, which characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, is dimensionless.

<DD>The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. Its precise value is 299792458 metres per second (approximately 3.00×108 m/s), since the length of the metre is defined from this constant and the international standard for time. According to special relativity, c is the maximum speed at which all matter and information in the universe can travel. It is the speed at which all massless particles and changes of the associated fields (including electromagnetic radiation such as light and gravitational waves) travel in vacuum. Such particles and waves travel at c regardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of the observer. In the theory of relativity, c interrelates space and time, and also appears in the famous equation of mass–energy equivalence E = mc2.

<DD>Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute matter (particles with mass) and radiation (massless particles). Although the word "particle" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), "particle physics" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest "known" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.

<DD>The fact that acoustic radiation from a violin at air-cavity resonance is monopolar and can be determined by pure volume change is used to help explain related aspects of violin design evolution. By determining the acoustic conductance of arbitrarily shaped sound holes, it is found that air flow at the perimeter rather than the broader sound-hole area dominates acoustic conductance, and coupling between compressible air within the violin and its elastic structure lowers the Helmholtz resonance frequency from that found for a corresponding rigid instrument by roughly a semitone. As a result of the former, it is found that as sound-hole geometry of the violin's ancestors slowly evolved over centuries from simple circles to complex f-holes, the ratio of inefficient, acoustically inactive to total sound-hole area was decimated, roughly doubling air-resonance power efficiency. F-hole length then slowly increased by roughly 30% across two centuries in the renowned workshops of...

<DD>BIOLOGICAL evolution happens by random mutation and selection. Technological evolution involves selection, too. Products preferred by customers are the ones that reproduce. But since technology is the product of conscious design, the mutation part of the process might reasonably be assumed to be deliberate rather than random. A study just published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society suggests, however, that this is not always the case. Nicholas Makris and his colleagues at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with Roman Barnas, a violin maker at the North Bennet Street School, in Boston, have been looking at the evolution of that instrument. One aspect of the process intrigued them in particular—the changing shape, over the years, of the holes in a violin’s body that allow the sound to emerge.

<DD>Before electronic amplification, instrument makers and musicians had to find newer and better ways to make themselves heard among ensembles and orchestras and above the din of crowds. Many of the acoustic instruments we’re familiar with today—guitars, cellos, violas, etc.—are the result of hundreds of years of experimentation into solving just that problem. These hollow wooden resonance chambers amplify the sound of the strings, but that sound must escape, hence the circular sound hole under the strings of an acoustic guitar and the f-holes on either side of a violin.

While the email transition is currently underway – Bell won the nearly $400 million contract last year – the decision quietly sparked a trade fight with the United States that placed the spotlight on the risks associated with hosting computer data outside the country. At the heart of the dispute is the emergence of cloud computing services such as web-based email, online document storage, and photo sharing sites. These services are based on a computing infrastructure that relies on huge computer server farms and high-speed network connections that allow users to access their content from any device connected to the Internet.

<DD>In mathematics and mathematical logic, Boolean algebra is the branch of algebra in which the values of the variables are the truth values true and false, usually denoted 1 and 0 respectively. Instead of elementary algebra where the values of the variables are numbers, and the main operations are addition and multiplication, the main operations of Boolean algebra are the conjunction and, denoted ∧, the disjunction or, denoted ∨, and the negation not, denoted ¬. It is thus a formalism for describing logical relations in the same way that ordinary algebra describes numeric relations. Boolean algebra was introduced by George Boole in his first book The Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847), and set forth more fully in his An Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854). According to Huntington, the term "Boolean algebra" was first suggested by Sheffer in 1913.

<DD>Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as idiopathic or primary parkinsonism, hypokinetic rigid syndrome, or paralysis agitans, is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system mainly affecting the motor system. The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease result from the death of dopamine-generating cells in the substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain. The causes of this cell death are poorly understood. Early in the course of the disease, the most obvious symptoms are movement-related; these include shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement and difficulty with walking and gait. Later, thinking and behavioral problems may arise, with dementia commonly occurring in the advanced stages of the disease, and depression is the most common psychiatric symptom. Other symptoms include sensory, sleep and emotional problems. Parkinson's disease is more common in older people, with most cases occurring after the age of 50; when it is seen in young adults, it is called young onset PD.

<DD>A fairy ring, also known as fairy circle, elf circle, elf ring or pixie ring, is a naturally occurring ring or arc of mushrooms. The rings may grow to over 10 metres (33 ft) in diameter, and they become stable over time as the fungus grows and seeks food underground. They are found mainly in forested areas, but also appear in grasslands or rangelands. Fairy rings are detectable by sporocarps in rings or arcs, as well as by a necrotic zone (dead grass), or a ring of dark green grass. Fungus mycelium is present in the ring or arc underneath. Fairy rings are the subject of much folklore and myth worldwide—particularly in Western Europe. While they are often seen as hazardous or dangerous places, they can sometimes be linked with good fortune.

Though rarely encountered by average users (Byte magazine estimated that 1 in 9 billion floating point divides with random parameters would produce inaccurate results), both the flaw and Intel's initial handling of the matter were heavily criticized. Intel ultimately recalled the defective processors.

<DD>Ambient music is a genre of music that puts an emphasis on tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Ambient music is said to evoke an "atmospheric", "visual" or "unobtrusive" quality. According to one of its pioneers Brian Eno, "Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting."

<DD>A niobium electrolytic capacitor is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) is made of passivated niobium metal or niobium monoxide on which an insulating niobium pentoxide layer acts as the dielectric of the niobium capacitor.

<DD>A tantalum electrolytic capacitor, a member of the family of electrolytic capacitors, is a polarized capacitor whose anode electrode (+) is made of tantalum on which a very thin insulating oxide layer is formed, which acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A solid or liquid electrolyte which covers the surface of the oxide layer serves as the second electrode (cathode) (-) of the capacitor. Because of its very thin and relatively high permittivity dielectric layer, the tantalum capacitor distinguishes itself from other conventional and electrolytic capacitors in having high capacitance per volume (high volumetric efficiency) and lower weight.

<DD>Electrolytic capacitor is the generic term for three different capacitor family members: Aluminum electrolytic capacitors, Tantalum electrolytic capacitors and Niobium electrolytic capacitors. All electrolytic capacitors (e-caps) are polarized capacitors whose anode electrode (+) are made of a special metal on which an insulating oxide layer originates by anodization (forming), which acts as the dielectric of the electrolytic capacitor. A non-solid or solid electrolyte which covers the surface of the oxide layer in principle serves as the second electrode (cathode) (-) of the capacitor. Due to their very thin dielectric oxide layer and enlarged anode surface electrolytic capacitors have—based on the volume—a much higher capacitance-voltage product compared to ceramic capacitors or film capacitors, but a much smaller CV value than electrochemical supercapacitors.

<DD>An aluminum electrolytic capacitor, usually simply called an electrolytic capacitor (e-cap), is a capacitor whose anode (+) consists of pure aluminum foil with an etched surface, covered with a uniformly very thin barrier layer of insulating aluminum oxide, which operates as a dielectric. The electrolyte, which covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, operates as the second electrode, the cathode (-). E-caps have the largest capacitance values per unit volume compared to the two other main conventional capacitor families, ceramic and plastic film capacitors, but articulately smaller capacitance than similar sized supercapacitors.

<DD>Melatonin, chemically N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a substance found in animals, plants, fungi and bacteria. In animals it is a hormone that anticipates the daily onset of darkness; however in other organisms it may have different functions. Likewise, the synthesis of melatonin in animals differs from that in other organisms. In animals, melatonin is involved in the entrainment (synchronization) of the circadian rhythms of physiological functions including sleep timing, blood pressure regulation, seasonal reproduction and many others. Many of melatonin's biological effects in animals are produced through activation of melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as a pervasive and powerful antioxidant, with a particular role in the protection of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.

<DD>I’ve been in the retrocomputing scene for about 15 years now and in that time I’ve seen the interest in the pursuit grow more and more. This is in large part due to the evolving technology that has brought devices that have made vintage hardware more accessible to users. One of the most influential class of devices that has made things easier for retrocomputing folks is the flash memory-based floppy disk emulator. No longer are physical spinning floppy disks needed to boot up most vintage systems, thanks to these embedded controllers that allow disk image files sitting an SD card to be used in lieu of physical media. I personally have such devices installed in three systems: an Apple IIe, an Atari 520ST, and an Amiga 2000. In the case of the last, however, the floppy emulator is hardly needed, and that’s because of something the Amiga community has going for it that I consider to be much, much better. It’s called WHDLoad, and it’s a dream come true.

<DD>Autoconfig is an auto-configuration protocol of Amiga computers which is intended to automatically assign resources to expansion devices without the need for jumper settings. It is analogous to PCI configuration. AutoConfig is integrated within the Amiga's Kickstart firmware, usually stored in ROM. When the system is switched on, AmigaOS interrogates each expansion device in turn and assigns address space or resources as needed. For example, in the case of a memory card, the OS can dynamically add the memory to the system.

<DD>AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. AmigaOS is a single-user operating system based on a preemptive multitasking kernel, called Exec. It includes an abstraction of the Amiga's hardware, a disk operating system called AmigaDOS, a windowing system API called Intuition and a desktop file manager called Workbench.

<DD>AmigaDOS is the disk operating system of the AmigaOS, which includes file systems, file and directory manipulation, the command-line interface, and file redirection. In AmigaOS 1.x, AmigaDOS was based on a TRIPOS port by MetaComCo, written in BCPL. BCPL does not use native pointers, so the more advanced functionality of the operating system was difficult to use and error-prone. The third-party AmigaDOS Resource Project[1] (ARP, formerly the AmigaDOS Replacement Project),[2] a project begun by Amiga developer Charlie Heath, replaced many of the BCPL utilities with smaller, more sophisticated equivalents written in C and assembler, and provided a wrapper library, arp.library. This eliminated the interfacing problems in applications by automatically performing conversions from native pointers (such as those used by C or assembler) to BCPL equivalents and vice versa for all AmigaDOS functions.

<DD>Amiga Disk File (ADF) is a file format used by Amiga computers and emulators to store images of disks. It has been around almost as long as the Amiga itself, although it was not initially called by any particular name. Before it was known as ADF, it was used in commercial game production, backup and disk virtualization. ADF is a track-by-track dump of the disk data as read by the Amiga operating system, and so the "format" is really fixed-width AmigaDOS data tracks appended one after another and held in a file. This file would, typically, be formatted, like the disk, in OFS.

<DD>In mathematics, the Gibbs phenomenon, discovered by Henry Wilbraham (1848) and rediscovered by J. Willard Gibbs (1899), is the peculiar manner in which the Fourier series of a piecewise continuously differentiable periodic function behaves at a jump discontinuity. The nth partial sum of the Fourier series has large oscillations near the jump, which might increase the maximum of the partial sum above that of the function itself. The overshoot does not die out as n increases, but approaches a finite limit. This sort of behavior was also observed by experimental physicists, but was believed to be due to imperfections in the measuring apparatuses. These are one cause of ringing artifacts in signal processing.

<DD>Ada Lovelace was born 200 years ago today. To some she is a great hero in the history of computing; to others an overestimated minor figure. I’ve been curious for a long time what the real story is. And in preparation for her bicentennial, I decided to try to solve what for me has always been the “mystery of Ada”. It was much harder than I expected. Historians disagree. The personalities in the story are hard to read. The technology is difficult to understand. The whole story is entwined with the customs of 19th-century British high society. And there’s a surprising amount of misinformation and misinterpretation out there. But after quite a bit of research—including going to see many original documents—I feel like I’ve finally gotten to know Ada Lovelace, and gotten a grasp on her story. In some ways it’s an ennobling and inspiring story; in some ways it’s frustrating and tragic.

<DD>The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code. The security model used for this is the origin-based security model commonly used by web browsers. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP. The goal of this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or s and long polling).

<DD>WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C. WebSocket is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers, but it can be used by any client or server application. The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol. Its only relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as an Upgrade request. The WebSocket protocol makes more interaction between a browser and a website possible, facilitating live content and the creation of real-time games. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the browser without being solicited by the client, and allowing for messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way a two-way (bi-directional) ongoing conversation can take place between...

This all works well when you're dealing with something like a database assets - but how does this translate to streaming data? (Or does it?) For instance, in the case of video, it seems silly to treat each frame as resource that I should query one at a time. Rather I would set up a socket connection and stream a series of frames. But does this break the RESTful paradigm? What if I want to be able to rewind or fast forward the stream? Is this possible within the RESTful paradigm? So: How do streaming resources fit within the RESTful paradigm?

<DD>Hysteresis is the time-based dependence of a system's output on present and past inputs. The dependence arises because the history affects the value of an internal state. To predict its future outputs, either its internal state or its history must be known. If a given input alternately increases and decreases, a typical mark of hysteresis is that the output forms a loop as in the figure. Such loops may occur purely because of a dynamic lag between input and output. This effect disappears as the input changes more slowly. This effect meets the description of hysteresis given above, but is often referred to as rate-dependent hysteresis to distinguish it from hysteresis with a more durable memory effect.

Launched in 1981, the cream machine came with 37 keys, 22 different instrument sounds, six onboard rhythms and a dedicated mini bass keyboard. It cost around $150 or, adjusting for inflation, about $400 if it were on sale today. Beneath that beige plastic, however, the MT40 hid a secret. A "rock" preset that, once discovered, would reverberate in popular music for the next 30 years. The preset would become one of reggae's most famous "riddims," inspire many imitations and force the genre into the digital age. The story of the "sleng teng" riddim (as it is known) in reggae history is well documented, but its origins are based on myth. This is the real story of how Casio's MT40 became the most influential keyboard of its kind.

<DD>Operation Gladio (Italian: Operazione Gladio) is the codename for a clandestine North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) "stay-behind" operation in Italy during the Cold War. Its purpose was to continue armed resistance in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion and conquest. Although Gladio specifically refers to the Italian branch of the NATO stay-behind organizations, "Operation Gladio" is used as an informal name for all of them. The name Gladio is the Italian form of gladius, a type of Roman shortsword. Stay-behind operations were prepared in many NATO member countries, and some neutral countries. The role of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in Gladio and the extent of its activities during the Cold War era, and any relationship to terrorist attacks perpetrated in Italy during the "Years of Lead" (late 1960s to early 1980s) is the subject of debate. Switzerland and Belgium have had parliamentary inquiries into the matter.

This technology is envisioned to be used in a wide range of applications both indoor as well as outdoor. Visible Light Communication (VLC) uses light emitting diodes (LEDs), for the dual role of illumination and data transmission. With this leading edge technology, data including video and audio, internet traffic etc can be transmitted at high speeds using LED light. Using LEDs is helping to drive this technology in the form of Visible Light Communication (VLC).

According to designer Tony Guido the question at Apple was: “What would it take to put the Mac on as many desktops as possible, without licensing, in a way that would convince DOS users to migrate toward the Mac?” At the same time hardware engineer John Fitch, having just completed work on the IIgs, was worried by the lack of follow-up product for the Apple II. Fitch wanted to design a computer around a new chip, the Motorola 68030, which would be powerful enough for business and high end applications, but could also be offered to home users. Inspired by the Apple II “open” architecture mindset, Fitch proposed a modular approach.

<DD>New Wi-Fi thermostats are available that allow you to remotely control the temperature in your home. Unlike other battery powered programmable thermostats, these new thermostats can't run on batteries alone and even if they can they will drain the battery quickly. It's therefor necessary to connect a "C" wire to these thermostats to provide power. This post details how I provided power to my thermostat that didn't have a C wire running to it by using a plug-in 24 volt AC transformer. With a C wire powering your thermostat you won't need to worry about the batteries dying and you can set the light on your thermostat to be always on to act as a nightlight.

Initially the pictures had a short note attached describing the frequency, package and the number of pins, but eventually more detailed chip specifications were added to the site, and the site was expanded with chip (primarily CPU) related information - identification, sockets, pinouts, S-Spec numbers, etc. After more than 8 years after the website was launched, we feature more than 7500+ CPU / FPU / MCU pages, 5000+ S-Spec numbers with about 1800 S-Spec numbers for engineerings / qualifications samples, more than 400 AMD stepping codes, and wealth of other data. Recently we added CPU comparison pages, and also started to cover CPU industry news. All of that wouldn't be possible without help of numerous contributors, who submitted insightful comments, CPU pictures, CPUID data, news stories, ran benchmarks, and provided suggestions and corrections.

<DD>We propose a theory of information expressed solely in terms of which transformations of physical systems are possible and which are impossible—i.e. in constructor-theoretic terms. It includes conjectured, exact laws of physics expressing the regularities that allow information to be physically instantiated. Although these laws are directly about information, independently of the details of particular physical instantiations, information is not regarded as an a priori mathematical or logical concept, but as something whose nature and properties are determined by the laws of physics alone. This theory solves a problem at the foundations of existing information theory, namely that information and distinguishability are each defined in terms of the other. It also explains the relationship between classical and quantum information, and reveals the single, constructor-theoretic property underlying the most distinctive phenomena associated with the latter, including the lack of...

<DD>A multi-agent system (M.A.S.) is a computerized system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents within an environment. Multi-agent systems can be used to solve problems that are difficult or impossible for an individual agent or a monolithic system to solve. Intelligence may include some methodic, functional, procedural approach, algorithmic search or reinforcement learning. Although there is considerable overlap, a multi-agent system is not always the same as an agent-based model (ABM). The goal of an ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents (which don't necessarily need to be "intelligent") obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in solving specific practical or engineering problems. The terminology of ABM tends to be used more often in the sciences, and MAS in engineering and technology.

<DD>In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is an autonomous entity which observes through sensors and acts upon an environment using actuators (i.e. it is an agent) and directs its activity towards achieving goals (i.e. it is "rational", as defined in economics). Intelligent agents may also learn or use knowledge to achieve their goals. They may be very simple or very complex: a reflex machine such as a thermostat is an intelligent agent.

<DD>An autonomous agent is an intelligent agent operating on an owner's behalf but without any interference of that ownership entity. An intelligent agent, however appears according to a multiply cited statement in a no longer accessible IBM white paper as follows: Intelligent agents are software entities that carry out some set of operations on behalf of a user or another program with some degree of independence or autonomy, and in so doing, employ some knowledge or representation of the user's goals or desires. Such an agent is a system situated in, and part of, a technical or natural environment, which senses any or some status of that environment, and acts on it in pursuit of its own agenda. Such an agenda evolves from drives (or programmed goals). The agent acts to change part of the environment or of its status and influences what it sensed.

<DD>Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision maker. MDPs are useful for studying a wide range of optimization problems solved via dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. MDPs were known at least as early as the 1950s (cf. Bellman 1957). A core body of research on Markov decision processes resulted from Ronald A. Howard's book published in 1960, Dynamic Programming and Markov Processes. They are used in a wide area of disciplines, including robotics, automated control, economics, and manufacturing.

<DD>Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning inspired by behaviorist psychology, concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. The problem, due to its generality, is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics, and genetic algorithms. In the operations research and control literature, the field where reinforcement learning methods are studied is called approximate dynamic programming. The problem has been studied in the theory of optimal control, though most studies are concerned with the existence of optimal solutions and their characterization, and not with the learning or approximation aspects. In economics and game theory, reinforcement learning may be used to explain how equilibrium may arise under bounded rationality.

Key pioneers featured include Léon Theremin, Bob Moog, Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk and Aphex Twin. The print loosely groups genres, from the obscure Musique Concrète (Pierre Schaeffer) to the better known Krautrock (Kraftwerk, Can, Tangerine Dream, Neu!, Faust, Cluster, Harmonia and Amon Düül II) Synthpop (Gary Numan, Human League, Depeche Mode, Yazoo and Pet Shop Boys) and Electronica (New Order, The Prodigy, Massive Attack, LCD Sound System and Daft Punk). There are also references to the experimental BBC Radiophonic Workshop and our...

<DD>The origins of electronic music—by which we mean not just dubstep and house, but anything produced with electronic music technology—are often traced back to Robert Moog. In 1964, Moog’s eponymous synthesizers made it simple for musicians to incorporate synthetic sounds into their recordings. The Monkees, The Doors, and The Byrds were early adopters of the Moog synthesizer; it was only a few years later that dance and disco were born. Moog can be credited with kickstarting our modern understanding of electronic music, but his synthesizer was actually based on technology from the 1800s. As this new chart from London studio Dorothy shows, you can trace the genesis of the genre to 1857, when a French inventor created the phonautograph. After that came the theremin, an instrument that used antennae to detect motion from the player’s hands. This was the machine that would eventually introduce Moog to electronics and the possibilities of electronic sound.

<DD>The goal of this website is to show you where TTC streetcars and buses are moving slowly and where they are moving well, at any given moment. It is intended to give you a bird's-eye view of what the TTC vehicles are doing along the route(s) between you and your destination, to help you decide whether to wait for a streetcar as opposed to taking an alternate route, walking, or doing something else. This is made possible by the GPS units that all TTC surface vehicles were equipped with in 2011, the data from which has been made freely available to the public by the TTC and NextBus. Behind the scenes, this website is constantly (i.e. every minute) downloading this data from NextBus and storing it. Then when your browser loads the page, it compiles recent data (typically the last half hour) to generate some graphics - coloured-coded stretches of road, and animated vehicles - which are shown on top of a google map.

<DD>Ever since the TTC made its GPS data available for open source developers, there's been a host of transit apps and real-time maps that have help to reduce the amount of waiting that riders have to do for buses and streetcars. Many of these plot arrival times and show where exactly one's next vehicle is on the streets of Toronto. This new map is a bit different in that it offers something of an overview of service conditions in general along a given route you want to take. Using multiple layers on a basic Google map, the TTC Skycam plots out the existing position of buses and streetcars, their position (animated) position over the last 30 minutes, and the relative speed at which they've moved over that same period.

It’s less about automation and more about personal augmentation; less about individual devices and more about “living services” that let people program and connect smart devices however they want. For instance, using one of these living services, I might connect my car to my smart garage door opener, which I’ve connected to my smart lock, which activates my smart thermostat that I’ve synced to my smart lighting system. I can program them all to simultaneously interact and do their jobs when I turn onto my driveway. My experience of coming home is enhanced, since everything is acting according to my preferences.

<DD>Capacitive sensing with grounded capacitor sensors is a very low-power, low-cost, high-resolution contact-less sensing technique that can be applied to a variety of applications ranging from proximity sensing and gesture recognition to material analysis and remote liquid level sensing. The sensor in a capacitive sensing system is any metal or conductor, allowing for low cost and highly flexible system design. The FDC1004 is a high-resolution, 4-channel capacitance-to-digital converter for implementing capacitive sensing solutions. Each channel has a full scale range of ±15 pF and can handle a sensor offset capacitance of up to 100 pF, which can be either programmed internally or can be an external capacitor for tracking environmental changes over time and temperature. The large offset capacitance capability allows for the use of remote sensors.

<DD>Capacitive sensing can present itself in many applications, ranging from proximity detection and gesture recognition to liquid-level sensing. Regardless of application, the defining factor of capacitive sensing is the ability to sense a change in sensor capacitance from a certain baseline. Depending on the specific application and system requirements, you may need different ways to measure this change. In this post, I will cover two specific types of architectures – the switched-capacitor circuit and inductor-capacitor LC tank circuit – currently being used in capacitive sensing.

This phenomenon is also sometimes described as mental inertia, "groupthink", or a "paradigm", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes. A mindset can also be seen as incident of a person's Weltanschauung or philosophy of life. For example there has been quite some interest in the typical mindset of an entrepreneur.

Identification was successful across scan sessions and even between task and rest conditions, indicating that an individual's connectivity profile is intrinsic, and can be used to distinguish that individual regardless of how the brain is engaged during imaging. Characteristic connectivity patterns were distributed throughout the brain, but the frontoparietal network emerged as most distinctive. Furthermore, we show that connectivity profiles predict levels of fluid intelligence: the same networks that were most discriminating of individuals were also most predictive of...

<DD>Complex systems present problems both in mathematical modelling and philosophical foundations. The study of complex systems represents a new approach to science that investigates how relationships between parts give rise to the collective behaviors of a system and how the system interacts and forms relationships with its environment. The equations from which models of complex systems are developed generally derive from statistical physics, information theory and non-linear dynamics and represent organized but unpredictable behaviors of natural systems that are considered fundamentally complex. The physical manifestations of such systems are difficult to define, so a common choice is to identify "the system" with the mathematical information model rather than referring to the undefined physical subject the model represents. One of a variety of journals using this approach to complexity is Complex Systems.

For mechanical systems, the phase space usually consists of all possible values of position and momentum variables. The concept of phase space was developed in the late 19th century by Ludwig Boltzmann, Henri Poincaré, and Willard Gibbs.

<DD>Chaos theory is the field of study in mathematics that studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions—a response popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general. This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply chaos.

<DD>Floris Takens (November 12, 1940 – June 20, 2010) was a Dutch mathematician known for contributions to the theory of chaotic dynamical systems. Together with David Ruelle, he predicted that fluid turbulence could develop through a strange attractor, a term they coined, as opposed to the then-prevailing theory of accretion of modes. The prediction was later confirmed by experiment. Takens also established the result now known as the Takens' theorem, which shows how to reconstruct a dynamical system from an observed time-series.

<DD>Scientific modelling is a scientific activity, the aim of which is to make a particular part or feature of the world easier to understand, define, quantify, visualize, or simulate by referencing it to existing and usually commonly accepted knowledge. It requires selecting and identifying relevant aspects of a situation in the real world and then using different types of models for different aims, such as conceptual models to better understand, operational models to operationalize, mathematical models to quantify, and graphical models to visualize the subject. Modelling is an essential and inseparable part of scientific activity, and many scientific disciplines have their own ideas about specific types of modelling.

<DD>It is well known that current equilibrium-based models fall short as predictive descriptions of natural ecosystems, and particularly of fisheries systems that exhibit nonlinear dynamics. For example, model parameters assumed to be fixed constants may actually vary in time, models may fit well to existing data but lack out-of-sample predictive skill, and key driving variables may be misidentified due to transient (mirage) correlations that are common in nonlinear systems. With these frailties, it is somewhat surprising that static equilibrium models continue to be widely used. Here, we examine empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) as an alternative to imposed model equations and that accommodates both nonequilibrium dynamics and nonlinearity. Using time series from nine stocks of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River system in British Columbia, Canada, we perform, for the the first time to our knowledge, real-data comparison of contemporary fisheries models with...

<DD>Sometimes ecological data just don’t make sense. The sockeye salmon that spawn in British Columbia’s Fraser River offer a prime example. Scientists have tracked the fishery there since 1948, through numerous upswings and downswings. At first, population numbers seemed inversely correlated with ocean temperatures: The northern Pacific Ocean surface warms and then cools again every few decades, and in the early years of tracking, fish numbers seemed to rise when sea surface temperature fell. To biologists this seemed reasonable, since salmon thrive in cold waters. Represented as an equation, the population-temperature relationship also gave fishery managers a basis for setting catch limits so the salmon population did not crash.

<DD>Translation is the communication of the meaning of a source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. Whereas interpreting undoubtedly antedates writing, translation began only after the appearance of written literature; there exist partial translations of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (ca. 2000 BCE) into Southwest Asian languages of the second millennium BCE. Translators always risk inappropriate spill-over of source-language idiom and usage into the target-language translation. On the other hand, spill-overs have imported useful source-language calques and loanwords that have enriched the target languages. Indeed, translators have helped substantially to shape the languages into which they have translated.

<DD>Lucid dreaming is a state of awareness that one is dreaming, without leaving the sleep state. Dream reports show that self-reflection and volitional control are more pronounced in lucid compared with nonlucid dreams. Mostly on these grounds, lucid dreaming has been associated with metacognition. However, the link to lucid dreaming at the neural level has not yet been explored. We sought for relationships between the neural correlates of lucid dreaming and thought monitoring.

At that point, you can choose to wake up (I usually do… I don’t think I’ve ever had a lucid dream that wasn’t a nightmare) or you can continue to dream on, with one important advantage. You’re now aware that the world around you is completely made up by your brain. As with the post-awakening of Neo in the movie “The Matrix”, you can bend the physical laws to your liking. You can fly, stop bullets with your bare hands, or even deliver magical punches to the bad guys to make them shrink in size (yeah, I have weird dreams). There is no spoon.

<DD>ICBEN is the International Commission on Biological Effects of Noise. Its goal is to promote a high level of scientific research concerning all the aspects noise-induced effects on human beings and on animals including preventive regulatory measures and to keep alive a vivid communication among the scientists working in that field. ICBEN is a non-profit organization that has no legal identity of its own and entirely depends on its members and its officers that voluntarily work for the organization. The means to achieve its goals are mainly based on the unique structure of ICBEN. The founders of ICBEN were wise enough not to concentrate the responsibility on the president of ICBEN but to delegate it primarily to the International Noise Teams (INT), in particular to the very experts who are appointed at the beginning of each 3-years term (and at the utmost for a second term).

<DD>The aim of the study was to investigate workers' perceptions of the acoustic environment of offices and study its relations to work performance and well-being. Questionnaire results from 11 companies and 689 respondents were analyzed. Occupants in private rooms and open offices were compared. Noise was the main indoor environmental problem in open offices. Speech was the most distracting source of noise in both office types but the degree of disturbance was lower in private rooms. About half of open office occupants and 20 % of occupants in private rooms were dissatisfied with acoustics. Office noise disturbed particularly conversations and tasks relying on working memory and verbal processes, such as text comprehension and creative thinking. Routine tasks were little disturbed by noise. In open offices, attempts to cope with noise reflected risk factors to individual productivity and well-being, such as taking extra breaks, compromising the quality of work, working overtime and...

<DD>The rise of the cubicle in the 1960s and ’70s began from a desire for private workspaces. They became so popular that offices used to look like cubicle farms, until these row-upon-row ‘bullpens’ began to draw criticism for their appearance and their limitations on peer interaction and collaboration. Over time, the walls came down and cubicles were abandoned to make workplaces more open and friendly. There are numerous factors driving this change, including minimizing costs, and maximizing use of space. However, many workplaces are switching to open-office design because it fosters and facilitates cooperation and collaboration among employees. While open-concept offices may look inviting, they can be noisy. Phone conversations, keyboard strokes, and meetings may not be loud individually, but when many employees are collectively combined in one space, it can be disruptive. Complaints about open spaces being too loud to concentrate should be a concern to employers and designers.

Sticking to these principles does not, sadly, guarantee that you’ll design a great flag (or anything else), but it’s a good start. However, as with all design, there are always outliers that violate the conventional principles, and still manage to delight and inspire. So, here are seven of my favorite flags that totally break the rules — and in doing so make the world a more interesting place.

Named for the town of Fulda, the Fulda Gap was strategically important during the Cold War. The Fulda Gap is roughly the route along which Napoleon chose to withdraw his armies after defeat at the Battle of Leipzig. Napoleon succeeded in defeating a Bavarian-Austrian army under Wrede in the Battle of Hanau not far from Frankfurt; from there he escaped home to France. The route was also used by the U.S. XII Corps during World War II to advance eastward in late March and early April 1945.

<DD>It looks like your extra effort to dispute a parking ticket might have paid off. The city of Toronto decided to drop 880,000 unpaid parking tickets issued between 2002 and 2014 over the weekend. Why, you ask? After looking into the cases, City lawyers determined that there wasn’t a good enough chance of winning the disputes since they’ve taken so long to go to trial. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms entitles the right to a trial within a reasonable amount of time, and for parking tickets that’s typically 12 to 16. Because pursuing hundreds of thousands of tickets outside of this time frame will likely not result in conviction, the City is avoiding inevitable administration costs of failed cases. The cancelled tickets could have brought an estimated $20 million in revenue.

<DD>This research investigates the paradox of creativity in autism. That is, whether people with subclinical autistic traits have cognitive styles conducive to creativity or whether they are disadvantaged by the implied cognitive and behavioural rigidity of the autism phenotype. The relationship between divergent thinking (a cognitive component of creativity), perception of ambiguous figures, and self-reported autistic traits was evaluated in 312 individuals in a non-clinical sample. High levels of autistic traits were significantly associated with lower fluency scores on the divergent thinking tasks. However autistic traits were associated with high numbers of unusual responses on the divergent thinking tasks. Generation of novel ideas is a prerequisite for creative problem solving and may be an adaptive advantage associated with autistic traits.

<DD>Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors. For example, it is possible that variations in four observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved variables. Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables. The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus "error" terms. The information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset. Computationally this technique is equivalent to low-rank approximation of the matrix of observed variables. Factor analysis originated in psychometrics and is used in behavioral sciences, social sciences, marketing, product management, operations research, and other fields that deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed...

<DD>The g factor (short for "general factor") is a construct developed in psychometric investigations of cognitive abilities. It is a variable that summarizes positive correlations among different cognitive tasks, reflecting the fact that an individual's performance at one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to that person's performance at other kinds of cognitive tasks. The g factor typically accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the between-individual performance differences on a given cognitive test, and composite scores ("IQ scores") based on many tests are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals' standing on the g factor. The terms IQ, general intelligence, general cognitive ability, general mental ability, or simply intelligence are often used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests.

This format is designed to measure the test-taker's reasoning ability, the eductive ("meaning-making") component of Spearman's g. (g is often referred to as general intelligence.) The tests were originally developed by John C. Raven in 1936. In each test item, the subject is asked to identify the missing element that completes a pattern. Many patterns are presented in the form of a 6x6, 4x4, 3x3, or 2x2 matrix, giving the test its name.

<DD>When looking in a science textbook or a toy mobile of the solar system, it’s easy to depict the sun, planets and moon to scale in comparison to each other. What’s not so easy to visually comprehend the staggering distance that separates each planet on its individual orbit around the sun. Filmmakers Alex Gorosh and Wylie Overstreet challenged themselves to build such a model and the result is this fascinating short film To Scale. Starting with the Earth as the size of a marble, it turns out you need an area about 7 miles (11.2km) to squeeze in the orbit of the outermost planet, Neptune. The team used glass spheres lit by LEDs and some GPS calculations to map out the solar system on the dry bed of the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. Once nighttime arrived they shot a timelapse from a nearby mountain that accurately reflects the distance of each orbital path at a scale of roughly 1:847,638,000. Amazing.

As we move ahead to an even more exciting era in aeronautical research and space exploration, we have added a new tool to enhance and symbolize the progressive path we have always followed. Not as suspenseful as a Command and Service Module splashdown nor as dramatic as a Mariner flyby, it is nonetheless of major importance because it is designed to achieve maximum communication of the agency's program objectives, both internally and externally. We have adopted a new system of graphics-the visual communications system by which we are known to those who read our publications, see our vehicle markings and signboards and the logotype that unmistakably brands them as NASA's."

I made use of a USB hub to power the boards, and a small Ethernet switch which I could hack to be also be powered from the USB hub rather from a separate wall wart. It’s hardly the biggest cluster built from Raspberry Pi boards, as far as I know the 120 Pi cluster built by the folks at Resin.io is still the biggest built, although since it’s actually 5 independent 24-node clusters, possibly the 66-board bramble built by GCHQ still takes the title.

<DD>In software engineering (and systems engineering), a functional requirement defines a function of a system and its components. A function is described as a set of inputs, the behavior, and outputs (see also software). Functional requirements may be calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing and other specific functionality that define what a system is supposed to accomplish. Behavioral requirements describing all the cases where the system uses the functional requirements are captured in use cases. Functional requirements are supported by non-functional requirements (also known as quality requirements), which impose constraints on the design or implementation (such as performance requirements, security, or reliability). Generally, functional requirements are expressed in the form "system must do ", while non-functional requirements are "system shall be ". The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design

<DD>In systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors. This should be contrasted with functional requirements that define specific behavior or functions. The plan for implementing functional requirements is detailed in the system design. The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is detailed in the system architecture. Broadly, functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do and non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do ", an individual action of part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a mathematical function, a black box description input, output, process and control functional model or IPO Model. In contrast, non-functional requirements are in the form of "system shall be ",

<DD>Foamcore is a great choice for quick prototyping. It is light and stiff, and can be easily adapted as you iteratively work out features of your design. Using simple tools such as a matte knife, a pencil, and a straight edge, you can easily score, fold, and cut foamcore. Making low-resolution prototypes with materials like foamcore is an important part of any design process. When the flow of ideas is crucial for divergent thinking and ideation, low resolution models are a great way to explore what is possible. By giving ourselves permission to experiment with quick, rough, iterative sketches, we avoid investing too much time and energy in a single idea from the outset.

<DD>What began as a search for oil led to the discovery of salt. The discovery of oil in Lambton County in the late 19th century had many believing that vast wealth might be just around the corner. Oil fever was rampant. In 1866 a Goderich man named Samuel Platt thought he’d take a chance. He raised $10,000, put together a company he called the Goderich Petroleum Company, and began drilling on the north shore of the Maitland River. When Platt reached 686 feet without striking a gusher, the partners walked and Platt nearly gave up, but the town and county chipped in $1,500 to keep the drilling going. Bingo. At 964 feet, Platt drilled into 60 solid feet of rock salt. This quantity of salt had never before been discovered in Canada. The Goderich Petroleum Company quickly became the Goderich Salt Company. A salt boom began that would last a generation. Sarnia sat 200 feet above immense salt deposits, but nobody knew it. Drillers in Warwick searching for oil also found salt, and more was...

<DD>Recent conferences on design are evidence of a coherent, if not always systematic, effort to reach a clearer understanding of design as an integrative discipline. However, the participants, who increasingly come from diverse professions and academic disciplines, are not drawn together because they share a common definition of design; a common methodology, a common philosophy, or even a common set of objects to which everyone agrees that the term "design" should be applied. They are drawn together because they share a mutual interest in a common theme: the conception and planning of the artificial.

<DD>Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met. This is contrasted with optimal decision making, an approach that specifically attempts to find the best alternative available. The term satisficing, a combination of satisfy and suffice, was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956, although the concept "was first posited in [his book] Administrative Behavior, published in 1947." Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He pointed out that human beings lack the cognitive resources to optimize: We can rarely evaluate all outcomes with sufficient precision, usually do not know the relevant probabilities of outcomes, and possess only limited memory. Simon formulated the concept within a novel approach to rationality, which takes into account these limitations.

<DD>Bounded rationality is the idea that when individuals make decisions, their rationality is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the time available to make the decision. Decision-makers in this view act as satisficers who can only seek a satisfactory solution, lacking the ability and resources to arrive at the optimal one. Herbert A. Simon proposed bounded rationality as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision making, as used in economics, political science and related disciplines. It complements "rationality as optimization", which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available.

<DD>Throughout most of history, design was a process applied to physical objects. Raymond Loewy designed trains. Frank Lloyd Wright designed houses. Charles Eames designed furniture. Coco Chanel designed haute couture. Paul Rand designed logos. David Kelley designed products, including (most famously) the mouse for the Apple computer. But as it became clear that smart, effective design was behind the success of many commercial goods, companies began employing it in more and more contexts. High-tech firms that hired designers to work on hardware (to, say, come up with the shape and layout of a smartphone) began asking them to create the look and feel of user-interface software. Then designers were asked to help improve user experiences. Soon firms were treating corporate strategy making as an exercise in design. Today design is even applied to helping multiple stakeholders and organizations work better as a system.

<DD>Polyphenols (noun, pronunciation of the singular /pɑli'finəl/ or /pɑli'fɛnəl/, also known as Polyhydroxyphenols) are a structural class of mainly natural, but also synthetic or semisynthetic, organic chemicals characterized by the presence of large multiples of phenol structural units. The number and characteristics of these phenol structures underlie the unique physical, chemical, and biological (metabolic, toxic, therapeutic, etc.) properties of particular members of the class. Examples include tannic acid (image at right), and ellagitannin (image below). The historically important chemical class of tannins is a subset of the polyphenols. The name derives from the ancient Greek word πολύς (polus, meaning "many, much") and the word phenol which refers to a chemical structure formed by attaching to an aromatic benzenoid (phenyl) ring, an hydroxyl (-OH) group akin to that found in alcohols (hence the "-ol" suffix).

<DD>Flavan-3-ols (sometimes referred to as flavanols) are derivatives of flavans that use the 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol skeleton. These compounds include catechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, thearubigins. Flavanols (with an "a") are not to be confused with flavonols (with an "o"), a class of flavonoids containing a ketone group. The single-molecule (monomer) catechin, or isomer epicatechin (see diagram), adds four hydroxyls to flavan-3-ol, making building blocks for concatenated polymers (proanthocyanidins) and higher order polymers (anthocyanidins). Flavanols possess two chiral carbons, meaning four diastereoisomers occur for each of them.

They were also less likely to feel tired or mentally drained, the findings, presented at the British Psychological Society annual conference in Brighton show. Prof David Kennedy, director of the brain, performance and nutrition research centre at Northumbria University, and a co-author of the study, said that chocolate could be beneficial for mentally challenging tasks. The findings suggest students who binge on chocolate when revising for exams may gain a real benefit from doing so. "For things that are difficult to do, mentally demanding things that maybe crop up in your work it could help," Prof Kennedy said.

<DD>Although much is known about the impact of sleep loss on many aspects of psychological performance, the effects on divergent ("creative") thinking has received little attention. Twelve subjects went 32 h without sleep, and 12 others acted as normally sleeping controls. All subjects were assessed on the figural and verbal versions of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. As compared with the control condition, sleep loss impaired performance on all test scales (e.g., "flexibility," the ability to change strategy, and "originality," generation of unusual ideas) for both versions, even on an initial 5-min test component. In an attempt at further understanding of whether these findings might be explained solely by a loss of motivation, two additional short and stimulating tests were also used-a word fluency task incorporating high incentive to do well and a challenging nonverbal planning test. Performance at these tasks was still significantly impaired by sleeploss.

<DD>Systems modeling or system modeling is the interdisciplinary study of the use of models to conceptualize and construct systems in business and IT development. A common type of systems modeling is function modeling, with specific techniques such as the Functional Flow Block Diagram and IDEF0. These models can be extended using functional decomposition, and can be linked to requirements models for further systems partition. Contrasting the functional modeling, another type of systems modeling is architectural modeling which uses the systems architecture to conceptually model the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a workflow, can also be considered to be a systems modeling language.

<DD>"Systems analysis is a problem solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to accomplish their purpose". According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, systems analysis is "the process of studying a procedure or business in order to identify its goals and purposes and create systems and procedures that will achieve them in an efficient way". Analysis and synthesis, as scientific methods, always go hand in hand; they complement one another. Every synthesis is built upon the results of a preceding analysis, and every analysis requires a subsequent synthesis in order to verify and correct its results. This field is closely related to requirements analysis or operations research. It is also "an explicit formal inquiry carried out to help someone (referred to as the decision maker) identify a better course of action and make a better decision than she might otherwise have made."

<DD>In business and engineering, new product development (NPD) is the complete process of bringing a new product to market. New product development is described in the literature as the transformation of a market opportunity into a product available for sale and it can be tangible (that is, something physical you can touch) or intangible (like a service, experience, or belief). A good understanding of customer needs and wants, the competitive environment and the nature of the market represent the top required factors for the success of a new product. Cost, time and quality are the main variables that drive the customer needs. Aimed at these three variables, companies develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy the customer requirements and increase their market share by a regular development of new products.

<DD>Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems in general, with the goal of discovering patterns and elucidating principles that can be discerned from, and applied to, all types of systems at all nesting levels in all fields of research.[citation needed] Systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of systems thinking or as the goal output of systems science and systems engineering, with an emphasis on generality useful across a broad range of systems (versus the particular models of individual fields). A central topic of systems theory is self-regulating systems, i.e. systems self-correcting through feedback. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate—and in human learning processes (from the individual on up through international organizations like the UN).

<DD>A system architecture or systems architecture is the conceptual model that defines the structure, behavior, and more views of a system. An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system. A system architecture can comprise system components, the externally visible properties of those components, the relationships (e.g. the behavior) between them. It can provide a plan from which products can be procured, and systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called architecture description languages (ADLs).

The purpose of service design methodologies is to design back and front office of services according to the needs of customers and the competences/capabilities of service providers, so that the service is user-friendly, competitive and relevant to the customers, while being sustainable for the service provider. For this purpose service design uses methods and tools derived from different disciplines, from ethnography (Segelström et al., Ylirisku and Buur, 2007, Buur, Binder et al. 2000; Buur and Soendergaard 2000) to information and management science (Morelli, 2006), and interaction design (Holmlid, 2007, Parker and Heapy, 2006).

A very broad concept, it is essentially the efficient and effective generation and development of ideas through a process that leads to new products. Due to the absence of a consensually accepted definition that reflects the breadth of the topic sufficiently, two discrete, yet interdependent, definitions are needed: one that explicitly defines product design in reference to the artifact, the other that defines the product design process in relation to this artifact.

Like many other design fields interaction design also has an interest in form but its main focus is on behavior. What clearly marks interaction design as a design field as opposed to a science or engineering field is that it is synthesis and imagining things as they might be, more so than focusing on how things are. Interaction design is heavily focused on satisfying the needs and desires of the majority of people who will use the product; other disciplines like software engineering have a heavy focus on designing for technical stakeholders of a project.

<DD>Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.

<DD>Design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system (as in architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams and sewing patterns). Design has different connotations in different fields (see design disciplines below). In some cases the direct construction of an object (as in pottery, engineering, management, cowboy coding and graphic design) is also considered to be design. Designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic, functional, economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process. It may involve considerable research, thought, modeling, interactive adjustment, and re-design. Meanwhile, diverse kinds of objects may be designed, including clothing, graphical user interfaces, skyscrapers, corporate identities, business processes and even methods of designing.

<DD>Divergent thinking is a thought process or method used to generate creative ideas by exploring many possible solutions. It is often used in conjunction with its cognitive opposite, convergent thinking, which follows a particular set of logical steps to arrive at one solution, which in some cases is a ‘correct’ solution. By contrast, divergent thinking typically occurs in a spontaneous, free-flowing, 'non-linear' manner, such that many ideas are generated in an emergent cognitive fashion. Many possible solutions are explored in a short amount of time, and unexpected connections are drawn. After the process of divergent thinking has been completed, ideas and information are organized and structured using convergent thinking. The psychologist J.P. Guilford first coined the term convergent thinking and divergent thinking back in 1967. Divergent thinking is also loosely called 'lateral thinking', a term coined by the thinking guru Edward De Bono- author of 'Six Thinking Hats'.

The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384–322 B.C.), though analysis as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. The word comes from the Ancient Greek ἀνάλυσις (analusis, "a breaking up", from ana- "up, throughout" and lysis "a loosening"). As a formal concept, the method has variously been ascribed to Alhazen, René Descartes (Discourse on the Method), and Galileo Galilei. It has also been ascribed to Isaac Newton, in the form of a practical method of physical discovery (which he did not name).

<DD>This toolkit contains the process and methods of design along with the Designer’s Workbook, adapted specifically for the context of K-12 education. It offers new ways to be intentional and collaborative when designing, and empowers educators to create impactful solutions. At IDEO, we’ve been using similar processes, methods, and tools for years in tackling some dauntingly complex challenges. More often than not, we’ve experienced how Design Thinking helps to get to the next step. That’s why we are excited to see how it can impact the world of education. Teachers at Riverdale Country School are starting to use design process to address challenges in their classrooms and schools, and together we’ve created this toolkit in order to share these processes more broadly. This is an invitation to experiment with the design process. Let it inspire you to approach challenges differently, and experience how Design Thinking adds a new perspective to your work.

Dr. Sacks, who died on Sunday at 82, was a polymath and an ardent humanist, and whether he was writing about his patients, or his love of chemistry or the power of music, he leapfrogged among disciplines, shedding light on the strange and wonderful interconnectedness of life — the connections between science and art, physiology and psychology, the beauty and economy of the natural world and the magic of the human imagination.

<DD>Thomas Edison created the electric lightbulb and then wrapped an entire industry around it. The lightbulb is most often thought of as his signature invention, but Edison understood that the bulb was little more than a parlor trick without a system of electric power generation and transmission to make it truly useful. So he created that, too. Thus Edison’s genius lay in his ability to conceive of a fully developed marketplace, not simply a discrete device. He was able to envision how people would want to use what he made, and he engineered toward that insight. He wasn’t always prescient (he originally believed the phonograph would be used mainly as a business machine for recording and replaying dictation), but he invariably gave great consideration to users’ needs and preferences. Edison’s approach was an early example of what is now called “design thinking”—a methodology that imbues the full spectrum of innovation activities with a human-centered design ethos.

<DD>Design thinking has come a long way since I wrote about it here in 2008. The most valuable company in the world places design at the center of everything it does. Designers are on the founding team of countless disruptive startups. Domains such as healthcare, education, and government have begun to prototype, iterate, and build more nimbly with a human-centered focus. Now that design thinking is everywhere, it’s tempting to simply declare it dead—to ordain something new in its place. It’s a methodology always in pursuit of unforeseen innovation, so reinventing itself might seem like the smart way forward. But in practice, design thinking is a set of tools that can grow old with us. And I’d argue that in order to create sustained competitive advantage, businesses must be not just practitioners, but masters of the art.

<DD>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Design Program is a modernist vision for an optimistic future. The logo (often referred to as the “worm”) evokes qualities of unity, technical precision, scientific capabilities and uniqueness. Reduced to its simplest form; the one width, continuous-stroke letters are as contemporary today as when the logo was first introduced by Richard Danne (Design Director) and Bruce Blackburn (Designer) at Danne & Blackburn, New York, NY) more than 37 years ago. How then, in 1992, after 19 years, did such an emblematic design program for a future-oriented Federal Agency be dropped for it’s previous (now current) Insignia (the “meatball”)? What follows is a heartfelt personal account from Mr. Danne on the obstacles and achievements of one of the century’s most important and widely published design programs.

<DD>Over at Display, Graphic designer Richard Danne tells the story of the fantastic "worm" logo he and partner Bruce Blackburn created for NASA in 1974. It was used for almost twenty years until the NASA administrator Dan Goldin unfortunately reinstated the previous "meatball" logo, developed in 1959. “The worm is a great-looking word mark and looked fantastic on the spacecraft,” famed Pentagram designer Michael Bierut once said. “By any objective measure, the worm was and is absolutely appropriate, and the meatball was and is an amateurish mess.”

<DD>Bringing back memories of NASA's early successes, this logo dates back to 1959, when the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA) metamorphosed into an agency that would advance both space and aeronautics: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). After a NASA Lewis Research Center illustrator's design was chosen for the new agency's official seal, the head of Lewis' Research Reports Division, James Modarelli, was asked by the executive secretary of NACA to design a logo that could be used for less formal purposes. Mr. Modarelli simplified the seal, leaving only the white stars and orbital path on a round field of blue with a red airfoil. Then he added white N-A-S-A lettering.

<DD>Out with “oot.” No more “aboot.” Canada is talking with a New Speak. In a linguistic pivot called the Canadian Vowel Shift, we are pronouncing “God” more like “gawd,” “bagel” like “bahgel,” “pillow” like “pellow,” and “sorry” less like “sore-y.” The word “Timbit” is becoming “Tembet,” and “Dan slipped on the staircase” now sounds more like “Don” “slept” on it. First discovered in 1995, the new vowels are contagious, spreading rapidly from Victoria to St. John’s, where linguists are mapping the frequency of people’s voices and using ultrasounds to track their tongue and lip placement. “We’re in the middle of a transformation,” says Paul De Decker, a sociolinguist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. “Our vowels are getting higher and backer in the mouth, and it’s more widespread, more diverse than we initially thought.”

<DD>Today Nokia is beginning to lay out its vision. At an event for the entertainment industry in Los Angeles tonight, Nokia is announcing Ozo, a next-generation camera for capturing audio and video in 360 degrees. Nokia intends for the device, which is now in its preproduction phase, to become the default mode of shooting virtual-reality experiences for Hollywood, the media, and the advertising industry. A formal launch, along with a final sale price, is planned for the fall. But Ozo is not a consumer camera — the device is expected to sell in the mid-five figures.

Reubens and director Tim Burton – at the time a relatively unknown, 26-year-old filmmaker stepping into his feature debut – would take us on one of the wildest cross-country road trips ever put on film, and they did it by barely leaving Southern California. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, L.A. Weekly recently spoke with the film’s production designer, David L.

<DD>When the twin Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977, they carried with them two Golden Records encoded with the sounds of Earth. As the spacecraft flew past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and out to the edge of interstellar space, the Golden Records were intended to serve as a greeting to any extraterrestrials the spacecraft might encounter along the way—like a "bottle in the cosmic ocean," as the late astronomer Carl Sagan put it. Among the sounds selected to represent all of humanity were recordings of rain, a mother and child, stone tools, a heartbeat, and more. Even if you’re not an alien with a golden record player, you can listen to these emotional and thought-provoking sounds, too. The recordings have been online for years now as clunky individual sound clips. But now, for the first time they’re actually easy to listen to—NASA just uploaded them to SoundCloud.

<DD>Telidon (from the Greek words τῆλε, tele "at a distance" and ἰδών, idon "seeing") was a videotex/teletext service developed by the Canadian Communications Research Centre (CRC) during the late 1970s and supported by commercial enterprises led by Infomart in early 1980s. The CRC referred to Telidon as a "second generation" system, offering improved performance, 2D color graphics, multi-lingual support and a number of different interactivity options supported on various hardware. With additional features added by AT&T Corporation, and 16 other contributors in North America and supported by the Federal Government, Telidon was redefined as a protocol and became the NAPLPS standard.

<DD>Teletext (or broadcast teletext) is a television information retrieval service created in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s by the Philips Lead Designer for VDUs, John Adams. Teletext is a means of sending pages of text and simple geometric shapes from mosaic blocks to a VBI decoder equipped television screen by use of a number of reserved vertical blanking interval lines that together form the dark band dividing pictures horizontally on the television screen.[1] It offers a range of text-based information, typically including news, weather and TV schedules. Paged subtitle (or closed captioning) information is also transmitted within the television signal. The first test transmissions were made by the BBC in 1973, known as Ceefax ("see facts"). After adoption in the UK the standards became international as the European Teletext standards and as the World System Teletext (WST). The World Wide Web began to take over some of the functions of teletext from the late 1990s, and many...

<DD>Videotex (or "interactive videotex") was one of the earliest implementations of an end-user information system. From the late 1970s to mid-1980s, it was used to deliver information (usually pages of text) to a user in computer-like format, typically to be displayed on a television. In a strict definition, videotex is any system that provides interactive content and displays it on a video monitor such as a television, typically using modems to send data in both directions. A close relative is teletext, which sends data in one direction only, typically encoded in a television signal. All such systems are occasionally referred to as viewdata. Unlike the modern Internet, traditional videotex services were highly centralized. Videotex in its broader definition can be used to refer to any such service, including the Internet, bulletin board systems, online service providers, and even the arrival/departure displays at an airport. This usage is no longer common.

<DD>In 1982, as new wave and queer punk were invading the Toronto music scene, a computer programmer and artist named Bill Perry brought a desk-sized computer to an artist-run video production centre called Trinity Square Video. While the music stuck around, the art created on that computer has been almost completely forgotten. The computer, made by a company called Norpak, was used to create graphics for a Canadian image transmission protocol called Telidon. The protocol was like a government-funded and corporate-controlled precursor to the graphical web, at least conceptually—and nearly a full decade before Tim Berners-Lee described the world wide web. Telidon could efficiently transmit crude computer graphics rendered in geometric primitives—such as circles and squares—over the phone lines and into people’s homes. The idea was that people could dial into central servers with keypads plugged into Telidon decoders hooked up to their TVs to shop, bank, and find someone to hook up with.

Even as I view this a positive, it comes with its own set of perils and pitfalls that will need to be avoided. Enterprise IT Application Development is often bureaucratic and involves multiple and redundant levels of management through the design, development and testing phases. Conflicting requirements from multiple stakeholders can make even the simplest of development efforts an intractable effort. For example, enforcing standardization is an underlying premise in most Enterprise IT Initiatives. In my experience standardization efforts undertaken without creating context and meaning around the standardization for the end users is self defeating in the long run. While Agile practices are in vogue and show some promise, they are a long way from dealing with the fundamental issues...

The system dates back more than 40 years and evolved largely to protect dairy farmers from food conglomerates. Today the Canadian Dairy Commission and provincial marketing boards regulate the price paid to farmers and control the amount each farmer produces.

The discovery, which amounts to a new form of matter, was made by the Hadron Collider's LHCb experiment.

<DD>Optical phenomena are any observable events that result from the interaction of light and matter. See also list of optical topics and optics. A mirage is an example of an optical phenomenon. Common optical phenomena are often due to the interaction of light from the sun or moon with the atmosphere, clouds, water, dust, and other particulates. One common example is the rainbow, when light from the sun is reflected and refracted by water droplets. Some, such as the green ray, are so rare they are sometimes thought to be mythical. Others, such as Fata Morganas, are commonplace in favored locations. Other phenomena are simply interesting aspects of optics, or optical effects. For instance, the colors generated by a prism are often shown in classrooms.

<DD>In meteorology, an inversion is a deviation from the normal change of an atmospheric property with altitude. It almost always refers to a "temperature inversion", i.e. an increase in temperature with height, or to the layer ("inversion layer") within which such an increase occurs.[1] An inversion can lead to pollution such as smog being trapped close to the ground, with possible adverse effects on health. An inversion can also suppress convection by acting as a "cap". If this cap is broken for any of several reasons, convection of any moisture present can then erupt into violent thunderstorms. Temperature inversion can notoriously result in freezing rain in cold climates.

<DD>A Fata Morgana is an unusual and complex form of superior mirage that is seen in a narrow band right above the horizon. It is the Italian name for the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, from a belief that these mirages, often seen in the Strait of Messina, were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to their death. Although the term Fata Morgana is sometimes applied to other, more common kinds of mirages, the true Fata Morgana is not the same as an ordinary superior mirage, nor is it the same as an inferior mirage.

<DD>In 1894 Toronto was a small city of around 200,000. Its church spires dominated the skyline and paddle steamers chugged through its harbour. Massey Hall had just opened, a gift to the city from a farm equipment manufacturer in memory of his deceased son, and the Evening Star, a precursor to the Toronto Star, was just a few months old. That year, on August 16 at around 10 in the morning, Buffalo woke to an unusual sight - it was Toronto, a town 90 kilometres distant as the crow flies, right on its doorstep. Looking north over land toward Niagara Falls and the distant city, which was easily visible from high ground around Lake Erie, it was as though the town had shifted over night to a point just on the horizon.

<DD>Professor William 'Bill' Tutte, who has died in Canada aged 84, made an unsurpassed contribution to the success of the British wartime assault on enemy codes and ciphers at Bletchley Park. Since 1974, a stream of hist-ories and memoirs - and, more recently, faction and fiction for stage and screen, as well as books - have encouraged the belief that Bletchley was all about Enigma. This German cipher machine, used by all three arms of the Wehrmacht, was certainly a prime concern for the teams of mathematicians, classicists, crossword fanatics and chess players who made such huge efforts to break into enemy signal traffic. Penetrating the toughest Enigma ciphers was crucial, for example, to victory in the Battle of the Atlantic against the U-boats, and with it the Allies' ability to invade north Africa, Italy and France.

Tutte is revealed as having been responsible for what experts have described as the single most important intellectual feat of World War Two - without this work, D Day would never have happened. Tutte broke a code ten times tougher than Enigma and, with a handful of brilliant men, allowed Churchill to 'hack in' to Hitler's own hotline, win the War and usher in the age of computers. Tutte's breathtaking genius was exploited by an amazing array of talent at Bletchley Park (the UK's top secret intelligence base) who then broke into Hitler's own communications network, changing the War and the world.

<DD>In combinatorics, a branch of mathematics, a matroid /ˈmeɪtrɔɪd/ is a structure that captures and generalizes the notion of linear independence in vector spaces. There are many equivalent ways to define a matroid, the most significant being in terms of independent sets, bases, circuits, closed sets or flats, closure operators, and rank functions. Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is the abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields. Matroids have found applications in geometry, topology, combinatorial optimization, network theory and coding theory.

<DD>Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. Aspects of combinatorics include counting the structures of a given kind and size (enumerative combinatorics), deciding when certain criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory), finding "largest", "smallest", or "optimal" objects (extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization), and studying combinatorial structures arising in an algebraic context, or applying algebraic techniques to combinatorial problems (algebraic combinatorics).

<DD>Gilbert Sandford Vernam (3 April 1890 – 7 February 1960) was a Worcester Polytechnic Institute 1914 graduate and AT&T Bell Labs engineer who, in 1917, invented an additive polyalphabetic stream cipher and later co-invented an automated one-time pad cipher. Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher in which a previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. To decipher the ciphertext, the same key would be again combined character by character, producing the plaintext. Vernam later worked for the Postal Telegraph Company, and became an employee of Western Union when that company acquired Postal in 1943. His later work was largely with automatic switching systems for telegraph networks.

<DD>Dopamine (contracted from 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a neurotransmitter of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays a number of important roles in the human brain and body. Its name derives from its chemical structure: it is an amine that is formed by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of L-DOPA. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior. Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and a variety of addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity. Other brain dopamine systems are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of several other important hormones.

<DD>MUSIC is not tangible. You can’t eat it, drink it or mate with it. It doesn’t protect against the rain, wind or cold. It doesn’t vanquish predators or mend broken bones. And yet humans have always prized music — or well beyond prized, loved it. In the modern age we spend great sums of money to attend concerts, download music files, play instruments and listen to our favorite artists whether we’re in a subway or salon. But even in Paleolithic times, people invested significant time and effort to create music, as the discovery of flutes carved from animal bones would suggest. So why does this thingless “thing” — at its core, a mere sequence of sounds — hold such potentially enormous intrinsic value?

<DD>A circuit diagram (electrical diagram, elementary diagram, electronic schematic) is a graphical representation of an electrical circuit. A pictorial circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a schematic diagram shows the components and interconnections of the circuit using standardized symbolic representations. The presentation of the interconnections between circuit components in the schematic diagram does not necessarily correspond to the physical arrangements in the finished device.[1] Unlike a block diagram or layout diagram, a circuit diagram shows the actual electrical connections. A drawing meant to depict the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called artwork or layout, physical design, or wiring diagram. Circuit diagrams are used for the design (circuit design), construction (such as PCB layout), and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

<DD>In software engineering, a software development methodology (also known as a system development methodology, software development life cycle, software development process, software process) is a division of software development work into distinct phases (or stages) containing activities with the intent of better planning and management. It is often considered a subset of the systems development life cycle. The methodology may include the pre-definition of specific deliverables and artifacts that are created and completed by a project team to develop or maintain an application.

<DD>Systems engineering is an interdisciplinary field of engineering that focuses on how to design and manage complex engineering systems over their life cycles. Issues such as requirements engineering, reliability, logistics, coordination of different teams, testing and evaluation, maintainability and many other disciplines necessary for successful system development, design, implementation, and ultimate decommission become more difficult when dealing with large or complex projects. Systems engineering deals with work-processes, optimization methods, and risk management tools in such projects. It overlaps technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, software engineering, organizational studies, and project management. Systems engineering ensures that all likely aspects of a project or system are considered, and integrated into a whole.

<DD>A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a graphical representation of the "flow" of data through an information system, modelling its process aspects. A DFD is often used as a preliminary step to create an overview of the system, which can later be elaborated. DFDs can also be used for the visualization of data processing (structured design). A DFD shows what kind of information will be input to and output from the system, where the data will come from and go to, and where the data will be stored. It does not show information about the timing of process or information about whether processes will operate in sequence or in parallel (which is shown on a flowchart).

<DD>A diagram is a two-dimensional geometric (can be three-dimensional also) symbolic representation of information according to some visualization technique. They have been used since ancient times but they became more prevalent during the Enlightenment. Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto the two-dimensional surface. The word graph is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.

<DD>A transit map is a topological map in the form of a schematic diagram used to illustrate the routes and stations within a public transport system—whether this be bus lines, tramways, rapid transit, commuter rail or ferry routes. The main components are color coded lines to indicate each line or service, with named icons to indicate stations or stops. Transit maps can be found in the transit vehicles, at the platforms or in printed timetables. Their primary function is to help users to efficiently use the public transport system, including which stations function as interchange between lines. Unlike conventional maps, transit maps are usually not geographically accurate—instead they use straight lines and fixed angles, and often illustrate a fixed distance between stations, compressing those in the outer area of the system and expanding those close to the center.

<DD>A straight-line diagram (abbreviated SLD) is a diagram of a road where the road is shown as a straight line. Such diagrams are usually produced by a highway department, and display features along the road, including bridges and intersecting roads. Rows below the diagram show data about the road, usually including speed limit, number of lanes, bridge numbers, and historical data, among other data. Subway lines also frequently employ straight-line diagrams. An internal SLD viewing system may also include links to other internal data, including photos or plans. Public SLDs are distributed in formats including PDF and TIFF. In Australia, "strip maps", which serve a similar function, are distributed by state automobile associations.

<DD>In cartography and geology, a topological map is a type of diagram that has been simplified so that only vital information remains and unnecessary detail has been removed. These maps lack scale, and distance and direction are subject to change and variation, but the relationship between points is maintained. A good example is the tube map of the London Underground. The name topological map is derived from topology, the branch of mathematics that studies the properties of objects that do not change as the object is deformed, much as the tube map retains useful information despite bearing little resemblance to the actual layout of the underground system. Not to be confused with a topographic map.

<DD>A schematic, or schematic diagram, is a representation of the elements of a system using abstract, graphic symbols rather than realistic pictures. A schematic usually omits all details that are not relevant to the information the schematic is intended to convey, and may add unrealistic elements that aid comprehension. For example, a subway map intended for riders may represent a subway station with a dot; the dot doesn't resemble the actual station at all but gives the viewer information without unnecessary visual clutter. A schematic diagram of a chemical process uses symbols to represent the vessels, piping, valves, pumps, and other equipment of the system, emphasizing their interconnection paths and suppressing physical details. In an electronic circuit diagram, the layout of the symbols may not resemble the layout in the physical circuit. In the schematic diagram, the symbolic elements are arranged to be more easily interpreted by the viewer.

<DD>A block diagram is a diagram of a system in which the principal parts or functions are represented by blocks connected by lines that show the relationships of the blocks. They are heavily used in engineering in hardware design, electronic design, software design, and process flow diagrams. Block diagrams are typically used for higher level, less detailed descriptions that are intended to clarify overall concepts without concern for the details of implementation. Contrast this with the schematic diagrams and layout diagrams used in electrical engineering, which show the implementation details of electrical components and physical construction.

<DD>Graphic design is the process of visual communication, and problem-solving through the use of type, space and image. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic design" is used interchangeably with these due to overlapping skills involved. Graphic designers use various methods to create and combine words, symbols, and images to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use a combination of typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce a final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.

In real-world terms, "dashboard" is another name for "progress report" or "report." Often, the "dashboard" is displayed on a web page that is linked to a database which allows the report to be constantly updated. For example, a manufacturing dashboard may show numbers related to productivity such as number of parts manufactured, or number of failed quality inspections per hour. Similarly, a human resources dashboard may show numbers related to staff recruitment, retention and composition, for example number of open positions, or average days or cost per recruitment.

<DD>When the Ontario government awarded a little-known company a contract to build two gas-fired power plants near Toronto in 2005, the move was hailed as a win for the environment, hydro consumers and the province’s electricity system. The company, Eastern Power Ltd., had never done anything that size before. But the government insisted the bid had been thoroughly vetted and Eastern would have to meet strict performance terms. Today, the project is in tatters, an embarrassing and costly bruise on Dalton McGuinty’s nine-year tenure as Premier of Ontario.

<DD>The Ontario power plant scandal or the gas plants scandal relates to the decisions by the governing Liberals to cancel the construction of two gas-fired power plants: one in Mississauga and another in Oakville. The Mississauga cancellation was made as a late campaign promise in the 2011 general election. From immediately after the Oct 6, 2011 election until March 18, 2013, the Liberal government continued to say the cost of the cancellations was $230 million -- $190 million for the Mississauga plant and $40 million for the Oakville plant. A final report by the Auditor-General released on October 8, 2013 found the total cost of the cancellations was at least $950 Million. The scandal contributed to the resignation of Premier Dalton McGuinty and Energy Minister Chris Bentley.

<DD>Around noon on a Thursday in April, a vertical support beam gave way inside a power plant under construction near Sarnia. The floor above the beam, on which the plant’s turbine was sitting, pressed down with 100 tonnes of force, putting a crack in a column and sending dozens of workers fleeing for safety. “There is a turbine sitting on top of the column which is now showing a large crack,” a government inspector wrote in a report on the incident at the Green Electron Power Plant. “Structural damage and possible failure.” Fearing the building was structurally unsound, tradespeople refused to go back to work. It took five days and a visit by the Ministry of Labour to resolve the problem and get construction running again. This was only one of the most dramatic incidents at the 289-megawatt plant.

<DD>A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations) and a set of the dyadic ties between these actors. The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.[1] The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics. Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and "web of group affiliations."[2] Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships. These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s...

<DD>In mathematics and computer science, graph theory is the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. A "graph" in this context is made up of "vertices" or "nodes" and lines called edges that connect them. A graph may be undirected, meaning that there is no distinction between the two vertices associated with each edge, or its edges may be directed from one vertex to another; see graph (mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.

<DD>In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a graph is a representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by mathematical abstractions called vertices, and the links that connect some pairs of vertices are called edges. Typically, a graph is depicted in diagrammatic form as a set of dots for the vertices, joined by lines or curves for the edges. Graphs are one of the objects of study in discrete mathematics.

<DD>Information visualization or information visualisation is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from scientific visualization: "it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given".

<DD>Graph drawing is an area of mathematics and computer science combining methods from geometric graph theory and information visualization to derive two-dimensional depictions of graphs arising from applications such as social network analysis, cartography, and bioinformatics. A drawing of a graph or network diagram is a pictorial representation of the vertices and edges of a graph. This drawing should not be confused with the graph itself: very different layouts can correspond to the same graph. In the abstract, all that matters is which pairs of vertices are connected by edges. In the concrete, however, the arrangement of these vertices and edges within a drawing affects its understandability, usability, fabrication cost, and aesthetics. The problem gets worse, if the graph changes over time by adding and deleting edges (dynamic graph drawing) and the goal is to preserve the user's mental map.

<DD>Mung or munge is computer jargon for a series of changes to a piece of data, which are often well defined and individually reversible, but which transform the original item into an unrecognizable form. The changes may be destructive, e.g. by corrupting a computer file, or simply concealing, e.g. changes to an email address to disguise it from spambots. The term was coined in 1958 in the Tech Model Railroad Club at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1960 the backronym "Mash Until No Good" was created to describe Mung, and a while after it was revised to "Mung Until No Good", making it one of the first recursive acronyms. It lived on as a recursive command in the editing language TECO.

<DD>Exploring data sets and developing deep understanding about the data is one of the most important skill every data scientist should possess. People estimate that time spent on these activities can go as high as 80% of the project time in some cases. Python has been gaining a lot of ground as preferred tool for data scientists lately, and for the right reasons. Ease of learning, powerful libraries with integration of C/C++, production readiness and integration with web stack are some of the main reasons for this move lately. In this guide, I will use NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas to perform data exploration. These are powerful libraries to perform data exploration in Python. The idea is to create a ready reference for some of the regular operations required frequently. I am using iPython Notebook to perform data exploration, and would recommend the same for its natural fit for exploratory analysis.

It is not clear whether some of his material was lost, whether they ignored him as a theoretical professor, or — who knows — used some of his stuff but did not tell him. In this hand-written letter sent by John Nash to the NSA in 1955, he tries to give a higher-level point of view supporting his design...

<DD>Schizophrenia (/ˌskɪtsɵˈfrɛniə/ or /ˌskɪtsɵˈfriːniə/) is a mental disorder often characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to recognize what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, auditory hallucinations, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and lack of motivation. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the person's reported experiences.

<DD>Game theory is the study of strategic decision making. Specifically, it is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers." An alternative term suggested "as a more descriptive name for the discipline" is interactive decision theory. Game theory is mainly used in economics, political science, and psychology, as well as logic, computer science, and biology. The subject first addressed zero-sum games, such that one person's gains exactly equal net losses of the other participant or participants. Today, however, game theory applies to a wide range of behavioral relations, and has developed into an umbrella term for the logical side of decision science, including both humans and non-humans (e.g. computers, animals).

<DD>In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players, in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy. If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium. The reality of the Nash equilibrium of a game can be tested using experimental economics method.

<DD>The Nobel Prize (Swedish pronunciation: [nʊˈbɛl], Swedish definite form, singular: Nobelpriset; Norwegian: Nobelprisen) is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian committees in recognition of academic, cultural and/or scientific advances. The will of the Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes in 1895. The prizes in Chemistry, Literature, Peace, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine were first awarded in 1901.[1] The related Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established by Sweden's central bank in 1968. The Nobel prize was made of the mixture of gold and silver with 24 carat or 4.8 g gold coating. Between 1901 and 2012, the Nobel Prizes and the Prize in Economic Sciences were awarded 555 times to 856 people and organizations. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 835 individuals (791 men and 44 women) and 21 organizations.

<DD>The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (officially Swedish: Sveriges riksbanks pris i ekonomisk vetenskap till Alfred Nobels minne, or the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel), commonly (and misleadingly) referred to as the Nobel Prize in Economics, and as a "category of the Nobel Prize" by the Nobel Foundation itself, which owns the name Nobel Prize, is an award for outstanding contributions to the field of economics, and generally regarded as the most prestigious award for that field. It is not one of the prizes that Alfred Nobel established in his will in 1895, but instead was established 73 years later by a donation to the foundation from Sweden's central bank, the Sveriges Riksbank, on the bank's 300th anniversary. Winners are announced on the same day as other Nobel Prize winners, and receive the award at the same ceremony.

<DD>The Nobel Prizes (Swedish: Nobelpriset, Norwegian: Nobelprisen) are prizes awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institute, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank, the central bank of Sweden, for contributions to the field of economics. Each recipient, or "laureate", receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money, which is decided by the Nobel Foundation, yearly.

<DD>John Forbes Nash, Jr. (June 13, 1928 – May 23, 2015) was an American mathematician whose works in game theory, differential geometry, and partial differential equations have provided insight into the factors that govern chance and events inside complex systems in daily life. His theories are used in economics, computing, evolutionary biology, artificial intelligence, accounting, politics and military theory. Serving as a Senior Research Mathematician at Princeton University during the latter part of his life, he shared the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with game theorists Reinhard Selten and John Harsanyi. In 2015, he was awarded the Abel Prize (along with Louis Nirenberg) for his work on nonlinear partial differential equations. In 1959, Nash was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and was committed to a number of psychiatric hospitals for treatment. After 1970, Nash was able to better control his mental illness and continue with his academic work. Nash's...

The game machines became fascinating technical and artistic platforms that were of limited real-world utility. The IBM products were all utility, with little emphasis on aesthetics and no emphasis on fun. Into this bifurcated computing environment came the Commodore Amiga 1000. This personal computer featured a palette of 4096 colors, unprecedented animation capabilities, four-channel stereo sound, the capacity to run multiple application simultaneously, a graphical user interface, and powerful processing potential. It was the world’s first true multimedia personal computer.

There was a reasonable amount of entertainment software available — much of it from the Amiga’s staunchest supporter, Electronic Arts — but nothing that felt quite as groundbreaking as EA’s early rhetoric about the Amiga would imply. Even the games from EA were mostly ports of popular 8-bit titles, modestly enhanced but hardly transformed. More disappointing in their way were the smattering of original titles. Games like Arcticfox and Marble Madness had their charms, but there was nothing conceptually new about them. Degrade the graphics and sound just slightly and they too could easily pass for 8-bit games. But then, timed to neatly correspond with that one-year anniversary, along came Defender of the Crown, the Amiga’s first blockbuster...

The vulnerability affects an estimated 8.4 percent of the top one million websites and a slightly bigger percentage of mail servers populating the IPv4 address space, the researchers said. The threat stems from a flaw in the transport layer security protocol that websites and mail servers use to establish encrypted connections with end users. The new attack, which its creators have dubbed Logjam, can be exploited against a subset of servers that support the widely used Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which allows two parties that have never met before to negotiate a secret key even though they're communicating over an unsecured, public channel.

The pharaoh ant, whose origins are unknown, has now been introduced to virtually every area of the world, including Europe, the Americas, Australasia and Southeast Asia. This species is polygynous, meaning each colony contains many queens, leading to unique caste interactions and colony dynamics. This also allows the colony to fragment into bud colonies quickly. Colonies do not display aggression toward each other; this is known as unicoloniality. Monomorium pharaonis is also notable for its complex foraging system, involving intricate trail routes maintained with several pheromones. It was the first ant species discovered to use a negative (repellant) pheromone. These chemicals are integral for communication in this species.

He has also recorded an album with Revenge (One True Passion), two albums with Monaco (Music for Pleasure and Monaco) and one album with Freebass (It's A Beautiful Life) as bassist, keyboardist and lead vocalist.

<DD>Ian Kevin Curtis (15 July 1956 – 18 May 1980) was an English musician and singer-songwriter. He is best known as the lead singer and lyricist of the post-punk band Joy Division. Joy Division released their debut album, Unknown Pleasures, in 1979 and recorded their follow-up, Closer, in 1980. Curtis, who suffered from epilepsy and depression, committed suicide on 18 May 1980, on the eve of Joy Division's first North American tour, resulting in the band's dissolution and the subsequent formation of New Order. Curtis was known for his baritone voice, dance style and songwriting filled with imagery of desolation, emptiness and alienation.

<DD>Unknown Pleasures is the debut studio album by English post-punk band Joy Division. It was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport in April 1979, with Martin Hannett as producer, and was released on 15 June 1979 by Factory Records. It followed an abandoned album for RCA Records. No singles were released from Unknown Pleasures, though the release of "Transmission" boosted its sales, despite the album failing to chart at the time. It has since gone on to receive critical acclaim and is considered a pioneering post-punk record.

<DD>Joy Division were an English rock band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of singer Ian Curtis, guitarist/keyboardist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris. Formed by Sumner and Hook right after they attended a Sex Pistols gig, Joy Division transcended their punk roots to develop a sound and style that made them one of the pioneers of the post-punk movement. Their self-released 1978 debut EP, An Ideal for Living, drew the attention of the Manchester television personality Tony Wilson. The sleeve's Germanic imagery drew criticism and speculation on their politics, not helped by later name changes. Joy Division's debut album Unknown Pleasures was released in 1979 on Wilson's independent label Factory Records. Aided by Martin Hannett's sparse production, it was a critical success with the British music press.

<DD>Cognitive flexibility has been described as the mental ability to switch between thinking about two different concepts, and to think about multiple concepts simultaneously. Despite some disagreement in the literature about how to operationally define the term, one commonality is that cognitive flexibility is a component of executive functioning. Research has primarily been conducted with children at the school age; however, individual differences in cognitive flexibility are apparent across the lifespan. Measures for cognitive flexibility include the A-not-B task, Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task, Multiple Classification Card Sorting Task, Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, and the Stroop Test. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) research has shown that specific brain regions are activated when a person engages in cognitive flexibility tasks. These regions include the prefrontal cortex (PFC), basal ganglia, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and posterior parietal cortex...

<DD>Imagination, also called the faculty of imagining, is the ability to form new images and sensations in the mind that are not perceived through senses such as sight, hearing, or other senses. Imagination helps make knowledge applicable in solving problems and is fundamental to integrating experience and the learning process. A basic training for imagination is listening to storytelling (narrative), in which the exactness of the chosen words is the fundamental factor to "evoke worlds". It is a whole cycle of image formation or any sensation which may be described as "hidden" as it takes place without anyone else's knowledge.[citation needed] A person may imagine according to his mood, it may be good or bad depending on the situation.

You don’t forget a sentence like, “We were somewhere around Barstow when the drugs began to take hold.” And you shouldn’t dismiss him, as some critics have, as a sloppy, self-indulgent, drug-ingesting hack. He took a lot of drugs, drank too much, loved guns and women (and excess in general) – he was a bit of a maniac to be sure, an imperfect character if there ever was one… and it is unfortunate that these facts obscure his real talent. Here are some of the best reasons why you should read his books and take him seriously.

<DD>Tinnitus can occur when damage to the peripheral auditory system leads to spontaneous brain activity that is interpreted as sound [ 1, 2 ]. Many abnormalities of brain activity are associated with tinnitus, but it is unclear how these relate to the phantom sound itself, as opposed to predisposing factors or secondary consequences [ 3 ]. Demonstrating “core” tinnitus correlates (processes that are both necessary and sufficient for tinnitus perception) requires high-precision recordings of neural activity combined with a behavioral paradigm in which the perception of tinnitus is manipulated and accurately reported by the subject. This has been previously impossible in animal and human research. Here we present extensive intracranial recordings from an awake, behaving tinnitus patient during short-term modifications in perceived tinnitus loudness after acoustic stimulation (residual inhibition) [ 4 ], permitting robust characterization of core tinnitus processes.

The release was in development within the Testing channel for quite a while, and, if you recall, Debian Linux consists of three major development branches: Stable, Testing, and Unstable. In order for a new iteration of Debian to officially go public, work must progress through each stage (starting in Unstable, ending in Stable). But it wasn't until the official feature freeze for this release in November 2014 that the contents of Testing really became what you'll actually find in Debian 8 today. If all that sounds complicated and slow, that's because it is. In fact, that's kind of the point. Debian Stable is designed to be, well, stable. The foundation of Debian is built upon long development cycles and a conservative approach to application updates.

Flying robotic cameramen can provide up-close views of things that aren't usually put under a magnifying glass.

Detroit does offer "urban exploration" tours of its wrecked warehouses — sagging remnants of an age when it was the Motor City, hotbed of American industrialism — but there's no flyover option. These drone images, however, take a somber look at disaster, dilapidation and one of the darkest moments in world history. Without them, we wouldn't be able to see the true face of our planet.

Accordingly, choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization. 'What is important' often depends on the department measuring the performance - e.g. the KPIs useful to finance will really differ from the KPIs assigned to sales. Since there is a need to understand well what is important, various techniques to assess the present state of the business, and its key activities, are associated with the selection of performance indicators. These assessments often lead to the identification of potential improvements...

<DD>Customer satisfaction is a term frequently used in marketing. It is a measure of how products and services supplied by a company meet or surpass customer expectation. Customer satisfaction is defined as "the number of customers, or percentage of total customers, whose reported experience with a firm, its products, or its services (ratings) exceeds specified satisfaction goals." In a survey of nearly 200 senior marketing managers, 71 percent responded that they found a customer satisfaction metric very useful in managing and monitoring their businesses. It is seen as a key performance indicator within business and is often part of a Balanced Scorecard. In a competitive marketplace where businesses compete for customers, customer satisfaction is seen as a key differentiator and increasingly has become a key element of business strategy.

<DD>Today, Silicon Valley is known around the world as a fount of technology innovation and development fueled by private venture capital and peopled by fabled entrepreneurs. But it wasn't always so. Unbeknownst to even seasoned inhabitants, today's Silicon Valley had its start in government secrecy and wartime urgency. In this lecture, renowned serial entrepreneur Steve Blank presents how the roots of Silicon Valley sprang not from the later development of the silicon semiconductor but instead from the earlier technology duel over the skies of Germany and secret efforts around (and over) the Soviet Union. World War II, the Cold War and one Stanford professor set the stage for the creation and explosive growth of entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley. The world was forever changed when the Defense Department, CIA and the National Security Agency acted like today's venture capitalists funding this first wave of entrepreneurship. Steve Blank shows how these groundbreaking early advances lead u

<DD>"Moore's law" is the observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon E. Moore, co-founder of the Intel Corporation and Fairchild Semiconductor, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit. In 1975, he revised the forecast doubling time to two years. His prediction had proven to be accurate, in part because the law now is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development. The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras. All of these are improving at roughly exponential rates as well.

<DD>The Davenport Diamond is a railway intersection near Dupont St. and Lansdowne Ave. where the East-West CP Rail tracks and North-South GO Transit Barrie Line tracks meet. Currently, these rail lines cross at-grade. GO/Metrolinx is planning to remove the "diamond" intersection by building a bridge to elevate their Barrie Line tracks over CP Rail's tracks. This would allow GO trains to pass through the intersection with no delays caused by passing freight trains. The bridge would start ramping up from just north of Bloor St., peaking at 8.5m high over the diamond, and returning to grade at around Davenport Rd. Newly created space under the bridge is intended to be given over to the community for amenities such as parkland, a trail, additional crossings through the rail corridor, etc. No actual plans have been finalized yet, but Metrolinx has chosen this general idea as a "preferred option", and is pushing to have this approved as soon as possible.

<DD>Conway's law is an adage named after computer programmer Melvin Conway, who introduced the idea in 1968; it was first dubbed Conway's law by participants at the 1968 National Symposium on Modular Programming.[1] It states that organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations —M. Conway[2] Although sometimes construed as humorous, Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation. It is based on the reasoning that in order for two separate software modules to interface correctly, the designers and implementers of each module must communicate with each other. Therefore, the interface structure of a software system will reflect the social structure of the organization(s) that produced it.

Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future was a snarky take on media and corporate greed, told through the eyes of investigative journalist Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) and his computer-generated alter-ego: an artificial intelligence named Max Headroom. Set in a near-future where global corporations control all media and citizens are hopelessly addicted to dozens of TV channels, the movie follows Carter — working for the mysterious Network 23 — as he discovers that network executives have created a form of subliminal advertising known as "blipverts" that can actually kill. While tracking the story, Carter is flung into a barrier marked "Max. Headroom — 2.3m." Desperate to maintain ratings with its star reporter, the network enlists a young hacker to download Carter’s mind and create a virtual version of the journalist. But things don’t go quite right. The result: the stuttering, sarcastic Max.

<DD>Subtractive synthesis is a method of sound synthesis in which partials of an audio signal (often one rich in harmonics) are attenuated by a filter to alter the timbre of the sound. While subtractive synthesis can be applied to any source audio signal, the sound most commonly associated with the technique is that of analog synthesizers of the 1960s and 1970s, in which the harmonics of simple waveforms such as sawtooth, pulse or square waves are attenuated with a voltage-controlled resonant low-pass filter. Many digital, virtual analog and software synthesizers utilise subtractive synthesis, sometimes in conjunction with other methods of sound synthesis.

To chronicle the Mondo moment and its impact, RU has launched a new project to create a Web history and book, and he's created a Kickstarter page to gather funding to make it happen.

<DD>Additive synthesis is a sound synthesis technique that creates timbre by adding sine waves together. The timbre of musical instruments can be considered in the light of Fourier theory to consist of multiple harmonic or inharmonic partials or overtones. Each partial is a sine wave of different frequency and amplitude that swells and decays over time. Additive synthesis most directly generates sound by adding the output of multiple sine wave generators. Alternative implementations may use pre-computed wavetables or the inverse Fast Fourier transform.

<DD>Karplus–Strong string synthesis is a method of physical modelling synthesis that loops a short waveform through a filtered delay line to simulate the sound of a hammered or plucked string or some types of percussion. Although this technique can be viewed as subtractive synthesis based on a feedback loop similar to that of a comb filter for z-transform analysis, it can also be viewed as the simplest of a class of wavetable-modification algorithms now known as digital waveguide synthesis, as the delay line acts to store one period of the signal. Alexander Strong invented the algorithm, and Kevin Karplus did the first analysis of how it worked. Together they developed software and hardware implementations of the algorithm, including a custom VLSI chip. They named the algorithm "Digitar" synthesis, as a portmanteau for "digital guitar".

<DD>In sound synthesis, physical modelling synthesis refers to methods in which the waveform of the sound to be generated is computed by using a mathematical model, being a set of equations and algorithms to simulate a physical source of sound, usually a musical instrument. Such a model consists of (possibly simplified) laws of physics that govern the sound production, and will typically have several parameters, some of which are constants that describe the physical materials and dimensions of the instrument, while others are time-dependent functions that describe the player's interaction with it, such as plucking a string, or covering toneholes.

Arriving at Bell Labs, New Jersey in 1964, he used Max Mathews' MUSIC IV software to digitally recreate the sounds of brass instruments. He made digital recordings of trumpets and studied their timbral composition using "pitch-synchronous" spectrum analysis tools, revealing that the amplitude and frequency of the harmonics (more correctly, partials) of these instruments would differ depending on frequency, duration and amplitude. He is also credited with performing the first experiments on a range of synthesis techniques including FM Synthesis and waveshaping.

<DD>In audio and music, frequency modulation synthesis (or FM synthesis) is a form of audio synthesis where the timbre of a simple waveform (such as a square, triangle, or sawtooth) is changed by modulating its frequency with a modulator frequency that is also in the audio range, resulting in a more complex waveform and a different-sounding tone that can also be described as "gritty" if it is a thick and dark timbre. The frequency of an oscillator is altered or distorted, "in accordance with the amplitude of a modulating signal." (Dodge & Jerse 1997, p. 115)

<DD>Icicles are familiar to anyone living in a cold climate. But what determines their shape and growth? Their distinctive forms emerge from the complex interplay between their evolving shape and the flow of air and water over their surfaces. These flows in turn control the release of heat needed to transform water into ice. Impurities in the water also play an important role, especially in the formation of ribs or ripples around the circumference of the icicle. The Icicle Atlas is a collection of images, time-lapse movies and time-series data on 237 distinct laboratory-grown icicles, made at the University of Toronto, Department of Physics, between 2008 and 2012. Each run of the icicle growing machine resulted in an icicle whose growth conditions were measured and controlled. These data were used in several published studies of icicle morphology.

Cold, hard facts How they grow An icicle begins when a dangling water droplet starts to freeze. The part that freezes first is near the foot of the droplet and it forms a hollow tube that continues to grow vertically downward. Icicles grow faster at the tip than on the sides, which gives them their familiar carrot shape. The rate of growth is a function of water flow and temperature.

<DD>Usenet is a worldwide distributed Internet discussion system. It was developed from the general purpose UUCP dial-up network architecture. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979 and it was established in 1980.[1] Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects, and is the precursor to Internet forums that are widely used today. Usenet can be superficially regarded as a hybrid between email and web forums. Discussions are threaded, as with web forums and BBSes, though posts are stored on the server sequentially.

<DD>Several months ago – maybe more like a year or two ago now, I purchased an Apple //c in mint condition and didn’t really have a plan for just where I would house this little treasure. You see, my second computer was an Apple //c (after my TI-99/4A), puchased in April 1984. It was a great experience owning and using that machine at the age of 12. I finally sold it and moved to the Mac, and then Amiga, and then Apple II again, and then… Well, let’s not get carried away. This story is about the //c – the //c I recently purchased. So the //c has been in my office since I purchased it. About two years now, I suppose. I’ve booted it seldom enough times to count on one hand – a sad situation. Well, I recently encountered a story that gave me a reason to use my //c a little more frequently – as in every day. It seems that Paul Weinstein put an Apple //c into his office setting, tied to his Mac mini via serial link, and proceeded to use the //c as a text terminal for IRC chatting.

Philippon had arrived in Halifax on a flight from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. The charge against him carries a maximum penalty of $25,000 and a year in prison. Rob Currie, director of the Law and Technology Institute at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, said that under Canadian law, travellers crossing the Canadian border have a reduced expectation of privacy.

<DD>The promise of quantum computing is computers powerful enough to break the encryption techniques we now use to protect the world’s data. But realizing that promise means, among other things, cracking a thorny paradox. A basic operation of any computer is checking for mistakes. But by the logic of quantum computing, the act of checking is itself likely to create an error. Researchers at Google have been trying to solve this problem, and now they believe they’ve made some progress. What you see above you is a tiny piece of aluminum film on a sapphire wafer built by the Google team. The nine miniaturized fire hose nozzle-type devices in the middle of the chip house quantum bits, or qubits—quantum computing’s more elaborate answer to the 1s and 0s of traditional microprocessors. The researchers say they’ve devised a sneaky technique for some of the qubits to check out their neighbors for errors without injecting new mistakes themselves.

What is even more extraordinary is the fact that it has been hand crafted. The thousands of parts that compose it are soldered together in a 3-dimensional structure. There is no electronic board involved. The parts are linked to hold themselves and reveal the complexity of the circuit through the solid wiring that keeps them together which gives a visually astonishing result. The symmetry and density of its parts and interconnections has been kept uniform throughout the circuit. Every single part that composes the clock has its purpose. If you would decide to take out a single part of the circuit the clock won't operate properly anymore.

These preferences were extrapolated by Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers from the typological theories proposed by Carl Gustav Jung, and first published in his 1921 book Psychological Types (English edition, 1923). Jung theorized that there are four principal psychological functions by which we experience the world: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. One of these four functions is dominant most of the time.

<DD>To recap, in Part 2 we introduced the input common-mode and output swing limitations of operational amplifiers (op amps), which are the fundamental building blocks of instrumentation amplifiers (IAs). We modified the internal node equations from Part 1 to yield equations for the IA’s output as a function of the device’s common-mode voltage and internal op amp limitations. In Part 3 Collin Wells joins me to discuss how to generate custom VCM vs. VOUT plots for an IA by graphing all six modified equations as a function of the IA’s common-mode voltage. This allows us to simulate custom VCM vs. VOUT plots and we demonstrate this using the INA333 VCM vs. VOUT model. Some instrumentation amplifiers, such as the INA826, level shift the inputs to increase output swing at common-mode voltages near the negative supply rail. We also introduce the concept of level-shifting and demonstrate this effect using the INA826 VCM vs. VOUT model.

<DD>In Part 1 we introduced the VCM vs. VOUT plot, common-mode versus differential-mode voltage, and instrumentation amplifier (IA) topologies. In Part 1 we also derived the internal node equations and transfer function of a traditional 3-op amp IA. In Part 2 we introduce the input common-mode and output swing limitations of operational amplifiers (op amps), which are the fundamental building blocks of IAs. The internal node equations from Part 1 are modified to yield equations that represent each op amp’s input common-mode and output swing limitation at the output of the IA as a function of the device’s input common-mode voltage. We examine a generic VCM vs. VOUT plot in detail and compare it to plots from device datasheets to corroborate the theory.

<DD>Common-mode voltage is the average voltage at the inputs of a differential amplifier. A differential amplifier is any amplifier (including op amps, difference amplifiers, and IAs) that amplifies a differential signal while rejecting the common-mode voltage. Figure 7 shows how to represent an input signal composed of a common-mode signal (VCM) and a differential-mode signal (VD).

<DD>The most prevalent TI E2E™ Community forum question concerning instrumentation amplifiers (IAs) revolves around common-mode voltage (Vcm) vs. output-voltage (Vout) plots. There are typically only a few of these plots in a data sheet based on commonly used power supply and reference voltage configurations. The issue is that the plots depend on the device’s supply voltage, gain and reference voltage. Therefore, if the final application uses power supplies, gain or a reference voltage that differ from those used to characterize the device, the plot will change. In this post, I’ll use the INA333 TINA-TI™ Vcm vs. Vout model to show how the plot changes with supply and reference voltage for a traditional three-op-amp IA. For more detailed information about the theory, model and how the plot changes with gain, see the three-part article published on EDN, “Instrumentation amplifier VCM vs VOUT plots”: Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 .

<DD>Hi. This page links to my other electronics and computer pages. A bit of background... I live in the UK (Wales, actually). I was born in 1966 and had my first soldering iron when I was eight. After many years of burnt fingers I am still going strong with electronics. From mid 1975 until late 80s I subscribed to Everyday Electronics - still have them all in a big stack, and have also managed to get hold of the ones from issue 1 to when I started. Also bought Practical Wireless, Popular Electronics, Hobby Electronics etc, to name a few. My interest in computers started in about 1977, so I was very active with the home computers at the start of the 80's and started with a Dragon 32 then went on to the wonderful BBC Micro. Over recent years I have turned to collecting some of the old computers, electronics kits and TV games, and I have rebuilt some of the computers (see below).

<DD>As a kid, Ela Darling fell in love with the idea of virtual reality. This was the late ’90s, early 2000s; Johnny Mnemonic and the Nintendo Virtual Boy had already come and gone, and VR had moved from brain-busting sci-fi concept to schlocky punch line to faded cultural footnote. But still, Darling was an avid reader and D&D player, and the idea of getting lost in an immersive world—“making visual what I was already losing myself in books for,” as she puts it—was something she found not just exciting but romantic.

<DD>SQRL or Secure, Quick, Reliable Login (pronounced "squirrel" /ˈskwɝl/ About this sound en (help·info)) (formerly Secure QR Login) is a draft open standard for secure website login and authentication. The software solution typically uses a QR code, which provides authentication, where a user identifies anonymously rather than providing a user ID and password. This method is thought to be impervious to a brute force password attack or data breach. It shifts the burden of security away from the party requesting the authentication and closer to the operating system implementation of what is possible on the hardware, as well as to the user. SQRL was proposed by Steve Gibson of Gibson Research Corporation in October 2013 as a way to simplify the process of Authentication protocol, without revealing any information about the transaction to a third party.

<DD>Since he supplied us with a visual vocabulary for cutesy dread over many decades, perhaps it comes as no surprise that Edward Gorey designed a set of whimsical tarot cards. The set is called the “Fantod Pack,” the word fantod signifying “a state of worry or nervous anxiety, irritability” and thus possibly the most Edward Gorey word ever. (David Foster Wallace was fond of the word as well, using the phrase “howling fantods” multiple times in Infinite Jest; the main clearinghouse website for DFW information is called The Howling Fantods.)

A lace lock, or heel lock, creates some extra friction between the laces at your ankle so you can keep the ankle and heel area tight, without having to tighten the whole shoe.

<DD>An Amiga 500 has no special ethernet or other network ports for connecting to the Internet. Typically a SLIP (serial line internet protocol) device is used to transfer all IP packets via the serial RS 232 interface to another computer with fast ethernet connection. With the on-board serial port a maximum speed of 9600 Baud (~ 1 KiB/s) could be achieved running Amiga OS. Faster speeds could be achieved by using a PLIP (parallel port IP) device that uses the parallel port to transfer IP packets to another host. Since the Amiga parallel port is fully bi-directional you can use a half-duplex protocol and then transfer an IP packet byte-by-byte over the port. This is done in the magPLIP driver available on Aminet. Unfortunately, this approach requires an Amiga or another Computer with a fully bi-directional port on the peer side. With this parallel approach you can achieve up to 15-20 KiB/s transfer speeds.

"New scenery continually erases what came before; memory is lost, shuffled, relabeled and forgotten. Gum is chewed; buttons are pushed; windows are lowered and opened. A fast moving car is the only place where you're legally allowed to not deal with your problems. It's enforced meditation and this is good."

AT&T is arguing that broadband has to be considered an information service and not a telecommunications service. This is important because only telecommunications providers can be treated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act, a designation that Wheeler will use to impose net neutrality rules.

<DD>The Space Shuttle Enterprise (NASA Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-101) was the first Space Shuttle. It was built for NASA as part of the Space Shuttle program to perform test flights in the atmosphere, aided by a modified Boeing 747. It was constructed without engines or a functional heat shield, and was therefore not capable of spaceflight. It was unveiled on September 17, 1976. Originally, Enterprise had been intended to be refitted for orbital flight to become the second space-rated orbiter in service. However, during the construction of Columbia, details of the final design changed, particularly with regard to the weight of the fuselage and wings. Refitting Enterprise for spaceflight would have involved dismantling the orbiter and returning the sections to subcontractors across the country. As this was an expensive proposition, it was determined to be less costly to build Challenger around a body frame (STA-099) that had been built as a test article.

Some published reports of the Pile unfortunately refer to it as an example of perpetual motion but the Guinness Book of Records has it under the “worlds most durable battery” delivering “ceaseless tintinnabulation”.

<DD>Well, there goes Alfred. That’s the first thought I had when I saw the new Spotlight in OS X Yosemite. I feared Apple had basically made my favorite little app launcher obsolete (we nerds call it “sherlocked”). I was wrong. It’s six months later, and Alfred is doing just fine, thanks largely to a vibrant community built around its power features, or workflows. Spotlight may be able to quickly launch an app from anywhere, but Alfred can tell the weather, eject attached hard drives, and control your Nest thermostat. And now, after five years on the Mac, Alfred is making the leap to iOS with a new companion app called Alfred Remote. Released today, it’s not going to be useful for most people, but serious Alfred users will love it. If anything, it’s evidence that you can still build a great app and community around core features offered by Apple.

<DD>This 1963 film shows how basic physical concepts are applied to make an optical maser oscillate. The optical maser is examined as a generator of electromagnetic energy in the optical range of frequencies, having many similar qualities to standard radio and microwave oscillators. The principal types of gas and solid-state optical masers are shown in the laboratory. Dr. C. G. B. Garrett of Bell Laboratories (and his prominent British accent) presents the material, which also includes lab demonstrations and animation. The Optical maser is a phrase that means the same as Laser - or Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A Laser is basically a Maser that works with photons in the light spectrum. There are optical and infrared masers, as profiled in the 1958 pioneering paper that introduced the concept to the world, written by Bell Labs scientists Charles H. Townes and Arthur L. Schawlow. Dr. Garrett worked with Dr.s Townes and Schawlow, and is shown here with the latter.

<DD>When we left Ken and Roberta, they had just made the momentous decision to use the Apple II’s bitmap graphics capabilities to create an adventure game that featured pictures in addition to text. Roberta would be the first to admit that she was no artist, but she was up to creating some sketches that would suit the purpose; in a world with no graphic adventures at all, people after all wouldn’t be too inclined to criticize the aesthetics of the first one to appear. Still, pulling it off would require them to overcome two other challenges: how to get the pictures into the Apple II in the first place, and how to store them in such a way that they didn’t consume too much space on disk. This latter problem arose because Ken and Roberta were determined to provide pictures for every single location in the game, amounting to some 30 illustrations in all.

<DD>Exploring new ways to share information with each other is a cornerstone of improving the planning process. To do this it is essential to have city-wide data in accessible formats. A variety of 3D digital information and models exist but currently the data is not readily available to the general public. Providing a consistent city-wide 3D data source will link these digital city planning models and materials together and will allow us to imagine our city from different perspectives. The Open Date site will enable access to to application developers, designers, urban planners and architects, and the public. Ideally this will enable the creation of a visual portal and access to a large collection of city building ideas.

<DD>The Yamaha DX7 is a phase modulation based (marketed as frequency modulation) digital synthesizer manufactured by the Yamaha Corporation from 1983 to 1986. It was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer. Its distinctive sound can be heard on many recordings, especially pop music from the 1980s. The DX7 was the moderately priced model of the DX series of PM (FM) keyboard synthesisers that included the larger and more elaborate DX1 and DX5; the feature-reduced DX9; and the smaller and not directly compatible DX100, DX11, and DX21. Over 200,000 of the original DX7 were made, and it remains one of the best-selling synthesizers of all time.

<DD>The Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) is the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope. It is part of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) site at Green Bank, West Virginia, USA. The telescope honors the name of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd who represented West Virginia and who pushed the funding of the telescope through Congress. The Green Bank Telescope operates at meter to millimeter wavelengths. Its 100-meter diameter collecting area, unblocked aperture, and excellent surface accuracy provide superb sensitivity across the telescope's full 0.1–116 GHz operating range. The GBT is fully steerable, and 85% of the entire celestial sphere is accessible. Its operation is highly efficient, and it is used for astronomy about 6500 hours every year, with 2000–3000 hours per year going to high frequency science. Part of the scientific strength of the GBT is its flexibility and ease of use, allowing for rapid response to new scientific ideas.

<DD>Electromagnetic radiation (EM radiation, EMR, or light) is a form of energy released by electromagnetic processes. In physics, all EMR is referred to as light, but colloquially light often refers exclusively to visible light, or collectively to visible, infrared and ultraviolet light. Classically, EMR consists of electromagnetic waves, which are synchronized oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate at the speed of light. The oscillations of the two fields are perpendicular to each other and perpendicular to the direction of energy and wave propagation, forming a transverse wave. Electromagnetic waves can be characterized by either the frequency or wavelength of their oscillations to form the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes, in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength: radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.

<DD>A Faraday cage or Faraday shield is an enclosure formed by conductive material or by a mesh of such material. Such an enclosure blocks external static and non-static electric fields by channeling electricity through the mesh, providing constant voltage on all sides of the enclosure. Since the difference in voltage is the measure of electrical potential, no current flows through the space. Faraday cages are named after the English scientist Michael Faraday, who invented them in 1836.

Referred to by a number of other abbreviations, including AUSCANNZUKUS and Five Eyes, it has also been described as the only software system which controls the download and dissemination of the intercept of commercial satellite trunk communications. It was created in the early 1960s to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War, and was formally established in the year of 1971.

Sounds nuts, but that's because it's the site of the gigantic Robert C. Byrd radio telescope, which scans space for signals that even a weak AM radio broadcast could overpower. As noted in this previous Boing Boing post, the town is a haven for “electrosensitives.” These are people who believe that wireless signals make them sick. Even in Green Bank, which maintains quiet by federal mandate, their beliefs clash with locals. The local sheriffs have had to intervene in disputes, including physical confrontations, between longtimers and the newcomers who demand that local businesses uninstall fluorescent lights, and want a church to stop using wireless microphones.

Even more impressive, it can do so using a battery that is so drained of energy as to be counted “dead” for almost all other purposes. I have not measured this value myself, but it is commonly claimed that a Joule Thief can light a white LED from a battery with an open-circuit voltage as low as 0.6.

<DD>In audio engineering, electronics, physics, and many other fields, the color of a noise signal (a signal produced by a stochastic process) is generally understood to be some broad characteristic of its power spectrum. Different "colors" of noise have significantly different properties: for example, as audio signals they will sound differently to human ears, and as images they will have a visibly different texture. Therefore, each application typically requires noise of a specific "color". This sense of "color" for noise signals is similar to the concept of timbre in music (which is also called "tone color"); however the latter is almost always used for sound, and may consider very detailed features of the spectrum. The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with "white noise", a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with "white light", which was (incorrectly) assumed to have such a "flat"...

<DD>LEGO is among one of the world's most recognised brand names. Most people would be familiar with LEGO's passive building bricks but how familiar are they with LEGO's electronic products? When I think about electronics and LEGO I think about the upper end of the Technics range (more complicated LEGO sets based around gears, pins, rods and beams) or the MindStorms products (sets revolved around the concept of a small programmable controller allowing for robotic type creations). However, electronics and LEGO go back a long way, long before the release of MindStorms. In fact it was back in the mid 1960s that kits with motors began. As a kid I remember being very impressed by the LEGO light bricks and motor powered vehicles. It was something special compared to the other generic LEGO parts. You have to remember that going back a few decades the variety of LEGO building blocks was not like it is today and Technic sets were not all that common.

This discussion applies to the majority of general purpose op amps on the market - as most op amps are internally compensated with a single dominant pole. High speed op amps, unconditionally stable op amps, non-unity gain stable op amps, high power opamps, etc. may not follow these characteristics because they are often compensated differently in their design. An LM358N is used for the example circuit. Other popular op amps like the LM741, etc. will behave in a similar way. Sometimes the slew rate limit of a device will be the dominant factor in determining the bandwidth, and other times the gain-bandwidth product will determine the resulting frequency response. The video demonstrates why this happens. Notes from the video are here: http://www.qsl.net/w/w2aew//youtube/o...

<DD>Nam Jun Paik was one of the first artists to engage seriously with electronic technology as both a subject and a creative medium, and he’s considered the father of new media art. Born in Seoul in 1932, Paik studied electronic music in Germany and began developing new forms of video art after he moved to the US. The Asia Society in New York is featuring a major retrospective of his work, including a cello made out of little televisions, a family — mama, papa, and baby — of robots, and a player piano stacked with video monitors that display a feed from surveillance cameras placed in the gallery. Paik was making these media sculptures in the 1960s and 70s, when video recording and cathode ray monitors were new. But for new media artists then and even now, it’s been difficult for artists to imagine that the latest technology would become obsolete so quickly. The parts become scarce, and the expertise to repair them even scarcer.

<DD>Finally after nine months, a progress update on HD20 emulation! Back in February I wrote about my efforts to reverse engineer the Apple HD20, an external 20 MB hard drive for the Macintosh that was introduced way back in 1985. This was before the introduction of SCSI support, so the HD20 connected via the Mac’s floppy port. With luck, that might make it possible to emulate an HD20 using the hardware I previously developed for Floppy Emu, the Macintosh floppy drive emulator. 20 MB (or more?) of external storage for a Mac Plus or other vintage machine, stored on an SD memory card, with no dependencies on SCSI or aging rotational disks! But doing it would require understanding how the HD20 worked well enough to emulate it.

<DD>The objective of many typical control system applications is to effect a control action based on the status of input control variables. Some of these include position, speed, angle, level, temperature and pressure. And for each of these control variables, you may need to optimize the design for ‘precise’ measurements, ‘precise’ control actions, and/or a fast ‘response time.’ In this series, I’ll discuss SAR ADC response times and several approaches to achieve the best results for your design.

<DD>The Ohio State University Radio Observatory was a Kraus-type radio telescope located on the grounds of the Perkins Observatory at Ohio Wesleyan University from 1963 to 1998. Known as "Big Ear", the observatory was part of The Ohio State University's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. Construction of the Big Ear began in 1956 and was completed in 1961, and it was finally turned on for the first time in 1963. The observatory completed the Ohio Sky Survey in 1971, and from 1973–1995, Big Ear was used to search for extraterrestrial radio signals, making it the longest running SETI project in history. In 1977, the Big Ear received the noted Wow! signal. The observatory was disassembled in 1998 when developers purchased the site from the university and used the land to expand a nearby golf course.[1] The design of the observatory is named after American physicist John D. Kraus (1910–2004), and is also used as the basis for the Nançay Radio Telescope.

<DD>The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal detected by Jerry R. Ehman on August 15, 1977, while he was working on a SETI project at the Big Ear radio telescope of Ohio State University, then located at Ohio Wesleyan University's Perkins Observatory in Delaware, Ohio.[1] The signal bore the expected hallmarks of non-terrestrial and non-Solar System origin. It lasted for the full 72-second window that Big Ear was able to observe it, but has not been detected again. The signal has been the subject of significant media attention. Amazed at how closely the signal matched the expected signature of an interstellar signal in the antenna used, Ehman circled the signal on the computer printout and wrote the comment "Wow!" on its side. This comment became the name of the signal.

Stoupin’s video is an incredible combination of macro, aquatic and time-lapse photography methods the likes of which we’ve never seen before. And that’s because the corals in this video are displayed at speeds that most of us have never seen before. These organisms move too slowly for us to really notice what they do.

<DD>For more information and stills gallery, please turn to: erikwernquist.com/wanderers (Just in case my website runs slow, here is a link to an imgur album version of the gallery: imgur.com/a/Ur5dP) Wanderers is a vision of humanity's expansion into the Solar System, based on scientific ideas and concepts of what our future in space might look like, if it ever happens. The locations depicted in the film are digital recreations of actual places in the Solar System, built from real photos and map data where available. Without any apparent story, other than what you may fill in by yourself, the idea with the film is primarily to show a glimpse of the fantastic and beautiful nature that surrounds us on our neighboring worlds - and above all, how it might appear to us if we were there.

These aren’t just fanciful places made up in the head of a special effect artist; those are worlds in our solar system that actually exist. And many were based on images taken through telescopes, or probes that have physically visited these distant locales.

<DD>Binaural beats, or binaural tones, are auditory processing artifacts, or apparent sounds, caused by specific physical stimuli. This effect was discovered in 1839 by Heinrich Wilhelm Dove and earned greater public awareness in the late 20th century based on claims coming from the alternative medicine community that binaural beats could help induce relaxation, meditation, creativity and other desirable mental states. The effect on the brainwaves depends on the difference in frequencies of each tone: for example, if 300 Hz was played in one ear and 310 in the other, then the binaural beat would have a frequency of 10 Hz.

<DD>It has been called the longest-running feature on CBC Radio. The National Research Council's official time signal was first broadcast on CBC Radio 75 years ago on Wednesday. On Nov. 5, 1939, as the Second World War was breaking out in Europe, Canadians first heard "the beginning of the long dash" which officially indicated the arrival of 1 p.m. eastern standard time. Since 1939, the time signal has been broadcast regularly on CBC Radio, allowing Canadians to set their clocks to the exact time set by the NRC. The signal served an important role in the pre-digital age, allowing Canadians access to exact time in a world of analog clocks which were not always reliable. In today's age of instant communications, GPS systems and 24-hour business transactions, the official time set by the NRC is perhaps even more important. People can now access accurate NRC time whenever they want on their computers and cellphones.

Many of the gathered were shoeless, and some were dancing to a rolling beat that issued from a pair of speakers. The scene was almost stereotypically countercultural; think the 1968 Democratic National Convention, displaced to a Berlin nightclub. My neighbor chatted with me about using new Web tools to organize progressive forces in Atlanta and about the possibility that there might be another leaker in U.S. intelligence. Several people hunched against the wall, staring at lines of code on their laptops. The room was packed, and so were the three lecture halls upstairs that had been booked for the tenth biennial Hackers on Planet Earth (H.O.P.E) conference, which is sponsored by the quarterly hacker magazine 2600.

<DD>A ramjet, sometimes referred to as a flying stovepipe or an athodyd (an abbreviation of aero thermodynamic duct), is a form of airbreathing jet engine that uses the engine's forward motion to compress incoming air without a rotary compressor. Ramjets cannot produce thrust at zero airspeed; they cannot move an aircraft from a standstill. A ramjet powered vehicle, therefore, requires an assisted take off like a JATO to accelerate it to a speed where it begins to produce thrust. Ramjets work most efficiently at supersonic speeds around Mach 3. This type of engine can operate up to speeds of Mach 6.

<DD>Between 1942 and 1952, some of Canada’s leading nutrition experts, in cooperation with various federal departments, conducted an unprecedented series of nutritional studies of Aboriginal communities and residential schools. The most ambitious and perhaps best known of these was the 1947–1948 James Bay Survey of the Attawapiskat and Rupert’s House Cree First Nations. Less well known were two separate long-term studies that went so far as to include controlled experiments conducted, apparently without the subjects’ informed consent or knowledge, on malnourished Aboriginal populations in Northern Manitoba and, later, in six Indian residential schools. This article explores these studies and experiments, in part to provide a narrative record of a largely unexamined episode of exploitation and neglect by the Canadian government. At the same time, it situates these studies within the context of broader federal policies governing the lives of Aboriginal peoples, a shifting Canadian consensus

Or maybe you need a recovery disk for older Macs that don't support the Internet Recovery feature. Whatever the reason, you're in luck, because it's not hard to make one.

<DD>The most common view of differential equations may be sheer terror, but those who get past terror may have one of the following perspectives. Naive view: All differential equations can be solved in closed form by applying one of the 23 tricks covered in your text book. Sophomoric view: Differential equations that come up in practice can almost never be solved in closed form, so it’s not worth trying. Learn numerical techniques and don’t bother with analytic solutions. Classical view: Some very important differential equations can be solve in closed form, especially if you expand your definition of “closed form” to include a few special functions. Analytic solutions to these equations will tell you things that would be hard to discover from numerical solutions alone.

<DD>The increasing homogenization (Pythonification?) of the tools I use on a regular basis primarily reflects the spectacular recent growth of the Python ecosystem. A few years ago, you couldn’t really do statistics in Python unless you wanted to spend most of your time pulling your hair out and wishing Python were more like R (which, is a pretty remarkable confession considering what R is like). Neuroimaging data could be analyzed in SPM (MATLAB-based), FSL, or a variety of other packages, but there was no viable full-featured, free, open-source Python alternative. Packages for machine learning, natural language processing, web application development, were only just starting to emerge. These days, tools for almost every aspect of scientific computing are readily available in Python. And in a growing number of cases, they’re eating the competition’s lunch.

<DD>For many crypto-minded libertarians, Bitcoin is the future of money. But that dream hasn't been helped much by the numerous high-profile legal cases involving the currency in recent years: The Bitcoin Savings and Trust hedge fund collapsed; uncertainty fueled the implosion of Mt. Gox, the currency's largest exchange; and the high-profile Silk Road takedown is a treacherous story combining Bitcoin, drugs, and alleged murders. For now, though, one company sits above all others when it comes to cultivating a new level of direct customer mistrust in the Bitcoin community: Butterfly Labs.

The case was filed in federal court last week in Missouri and unsealed late Monday, and it comes over a year after Ars first reported on the company and began testing its initial round of specialized computers designed to do nothing but mine for Bitcoin.

A 33-story, completely windowless building in the middle of downtown NYC that manages to vanish. It's a building built for machines, not people, to use: floor heights, layouts, and utility taps all distributed for optimal cooling, data transmission, and security. The ground floor bristles with infrared illuminators, CCTV cameras, and bomb-proof gates - it's hard even to pick out where people might get in.

<DD>We demonstrated physical side-channel attacks on a popular software implementation of RSA and ElGamal, running on laptop computers. Our attacks use novel side channels and are based on the observation that the "ground" electric potential in many computers fluctuates in a computation-dependent way. An attacker can measure this signal by touching exposed metal on the computer's chassis with a plain wire, or even with a bare hand. The signal can also be measured at the remote end of Ethernet, VGA or USB cables. Through suitable cryptanalysis and signal processing, we have extracted 4096-bit RSA keys and 3072-bit ElGamal keys from laptops, via each of these channels, as well as via power analysis and electromagnetic probing. Despite the GHz-scale clock rate of the laptops and numerous noise sources, the full attacks require a few seconds of measurements using Medium Frequency signals (around 2 MHz), or one hour using Low Frequency signals (up to 40 kHz). We have extracted keys from lapto

Though Toronto's squirrel population appears to be diverse, the grey, black, white, and tan creatures that populate Trinity Bellwoods and High Park are all simply Eastern Grey Squirrels, a name that is somewhat misleading and restrictive when it comes to varieties of colour.

In a differential signal path most ambient noise is coupled as common mode noise. Many differential devices are very good at rejecting this noise.

First there was the independent report conducted by former Supreme Court judge Frank Iacobucci that suggested, in the wake of Sammy Yatim’s killing, Toronto cops start wearing body-worn cameras, while also beefing up their taser supply, so that police can hopefully resist the urge to fire their guns into “people in crisis.” Then, shortly after, news broke that police chief Bill Blair did not have his contract renewed by the police services board. Many credit the board’s choice of not renewing Blair’s contract to two major scandals: one, his inconclusive surveillance of the city’s crack smoking mayor, and two, TPS’s handling of the G20 protests in Toronto. Blair spun the G20 as best as he could, given that he was personally open to discussing it in public (after, of course, refusing to provide an apology) and willing to pursue disciplinary action against his most aggressive officers.

<DD>When designing a high-performance data acquisition system, a diligent engineer carefully selects a precision analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and the additional components needed for the analog front-end conditioning circuit. After spending weeks designing, performing simulations and optimizing the schematic, the designer quickly puts board layout together to meet a tight deadline. A week later, the first prototype board is tested. To his or her surprise, the circuit does not perform as expected. Has this ever happened to you?

<DD>I read somewhere that the Adafruit C++ library has a bug in the INA219 High Side current measuring device library so the device doesn’t correctly return negative values for current.  Obviously, for a solar power system, I need to measure negative currents (current goes both out of and into the battery- when charging). I ran across this problem a couple of months ago and figured it out. I was using the Subfact Python library for the INA219.  There is also a similar bug in the subfact python library as in the Adafruit C++ library for the INA219 (fixed as of November 2013). They aren’t calculating twos complement correctly, so negative currents aren’t reported correctly.

<DD>Part 2 of 2: Two commonly asked questions when designing an operational amplifier into a new application are: 1. What is its “typical” power dissipation? Covered in my first post. 2. What is its “maximum” power dissipation? The op amp’s maximum power should be evaluated in the intended circuit. Let’s assume the first case where the amplifier is being operated as such. Let’s load the output with the lowest load resistance RL, as listed in the OPA 316 Electrical Characteristics table. The table lists 2 kΩ (red oval).

<DD>Two commonly asked questions when designing an operational amplifier into a new application are: What is its “typical” power dissipation? What is its “maximum” power dissipation? Most often these questions are asked in conjunction with other questions regarding the device’s various thermal resistance characteristics. These are part of a standard bank of questions used to gauge a device’s power-handling capability and help disclose any potential long-term reliability concerns. An amplifier’s data sheet may not list power dissipation information, but usually it does provide the operating voltage range, and typical and maximum operating currents. Answering the first question about “typical” power is normally straightforward. It is a matter of applying the power formula, PDQ = VS∙IQ, where PDQ is the quiescent power, VS is the supply voltage and IQ is the “typical,” quiescent operating current.

<DD>In 1994, among the reasons Microsoft started a website was to put its growing Knowledge Base online. At the time, the company managed support forums for customers on CompuServe, one of the earliest major Internet dial-up service providers. “We had started to build up a community there; people would answer questions for each other,” recalls Mark Ingalls, a Microsoft engineer in 1994 who would become Microsoft.com’s first administrator. He was also the only website employee at that time, other than his boss. But the staff doubled early on, when Steve Heaney was hired to offer vacation relief, Ingalls says. In terms of “Web design,” the notion, much less the phrase, didn’t really exist. “There wasn’t much for authoring tools,” Ingalls says. “There was this thing called HTML that almost nobody knew.” Information that was submitted for the new Microsoft.com website often came to Ingalls via 3-1/2-inch floppy disks.

<DD>The Unix philosophy, originated by Ken Thompson, is a set of cultural norms and philosophical approaches to developing small yet capable software based on the experience of leading developers of the Unix operating system. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a "software tools" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the "Unix philosophy." The Unix philosophy emphasizes building short, simple, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability rather than contextual design.

Bill Ackerman encoded a version of all four movements of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik; this may have been the longest single musical work ever played on a PDP-1. The hardware allowed four-part harmony, but no dynamics or instrumental synthesis. At the time, circa 1964, the Moog synthesizer was about ten years in the future. To be sure, the room-filling RCA music synthesizer was a decade in the past, and elaborate D-to-A wave-synthesis music was being generated on 7090-class machines at Bell Labs (by John Pierce, M. V.

<DD>A wired glove (sometimes called a "dataglove" or "cyberglove") is an input device for human–computer interaction worn like a glove. Various sensor technologies are used to capture physical data such as bending of fingers. Often a motion tracker, such as a magnetic tracking device or inertial tracking device, is attached to capture the global position/rotation data of the glove. These movements are then interpreted by the software that accompanies the glove, so any one movement can mean any number of things. Gestures can then be categorized into useful information, such as to recognize Sign Language or other symbolic functions. Expensive high-end wired gloves can also provide haptic feedback, which is a simulation of the sense of touch. This allows a wired glove to also be used as an output device. Traditionally, wired gloves have only been available at a huge cost, with the finger bend sensors and the tracking device having to be bought separately.

The Fourier transform and Fourier's Law are also named in his honour. Fourier is also generally credited with the discovery of the greenhouse effect.

<DD>In mathematics, a Fourier series (English pronunciation: /ˈfɔərieɪ/) is a way to represent a wave-like function as a combination of simple sine waves. More formally, it decomposes any periodic function or periodic signal into the sum of a (possibly infinite) set of simple oscillating functions, namely sines and cosines (or complex exponentials). The Discrete-time Fourier transform is a periodic function, often defined in terms of a Fourier series. And the Z-transform reduces to a Fourier series for the important case |z|=1. Fourier series is also central to the original proof of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem. The study of Fourier series is a branch of Fourier analysis.

<DD>The Lagrangian points (/ləˈɡrɑːndʒiən/; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are the five positions in an orbital configuration where a small object affected only by gravity can theoretically be part of a constant-shape pattern with two larger objects (such as a satellite with respect to the Earth and Moon). The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. A satellite at L1 would have the same angular velocity of the earth with respect to the sun and hence it would maintain the same position with respect to the sun as seen from the earth. Without the earth's gravitational influence, a satellite of the sun, at the distance of L1, would have to move at a higher angular velocity than that of the earth.

<DD>The Lagrangian points are the five locations in an orbital system where the combined gravitational force of two large masses is exactly canceled out by the centrifugal force arising from the rotating reference frame. At these five points, the net force on a third body (of negligible mass) is 0, allowing the third object to be completely stationary relative to the two other masses. That is, when placed at any of these points, the third body stays perfectly still in the rotating frame.

This can be made much smaller than a discrete circuit made from independent components. ICs can be made very compact, having up to several billion transistors and other electronic components in an area the size of a fingernail. The width of each conducting line in a circuit can be made smaller and smaller as the technology advances; in 2008 it dropped below 100 nanometers and in 2013 it was expected to be in the tens of nanometers.

The output when used as a voltage-to-frequency converter is a pulse train at a frequency precisely proportional to the applied input voltage. Thus, it provides all the inherent advantages of the voltage-to-frequency conversion techniques, and is easy to apply in all standard voltage-to-frequency converter applications. Further, the LM231A/LM331A attain a new high level of accuracy versus temperature which could only be attained with expensive voltage-to-frequency modules. Additionally the LM231/331 are ideally suited for use in digital systems at low power supply voltages and can provide low-cost analog-to-digital conversion in microprocessor-controlled systems.

<DD>A sound synthesizer (often abbreviated as "synthesizer" or "synth") is an electronic musical instrument capable of producing a wide range of sounds. Synthesizers may either imitate other instruments ("imitative synthesis") or generate new timbres. They can be played (controlled) via a variety of different input devices (including keyboards, music sequencers and instrument controllers). Synthesizers generate electric signals (waveforms), and can finally be converted to sound through loudspeakers or headphones.

<DD>Low-frequency oscillation (LFO) is an electronic signal which is usually below 20 Hz and creates a rhythmic pulse or sweep. This pulse or sweep is often used to modulate synthesizers, delay lines and other audio equipment in order to create effects used in the production of electronic music. Audio effects such as vibrato, tremolo and phasing are examples. The abbreviation is also very often used to refer to low-frequency oscillators themselves.

<DD>A variable-gain or voltage-controlled amplifier is an electronic amplifier that varies its gain depending on a control voltage (often abbreviated CV). VCAs have many applications, including audio level compression, synthesizers and amplitude modulation. A crude example is a typical inverting op-amp configuration with a light-dependent resistor (LDR) in the feedback loop. The gain of the amplifier then depends on the light falling on the LDR, which can be provided by an LED (an optocoupler). The gain of the amplifier is then controllable by the current through the LED. This is similar to the circuits used in optical audio compressors.

<DD>A voltage-controlled filter (VCF) is a processor, a filter whose operating characteristics (primarily cutoff frequency) can be controlled by means of a control voltage applied to control inputs.[1] It can be considered to be a frequency-dependent amplifier. Although popularly known for their use in analog music synthesizers, in general, they have other applications in military and industrial electronics. Depiction of cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter, showing Butterworth response A VCF allows its cutoff frequency and Q factor (resonance at the cutoff frequency), to be continuously varied; the signal outputs may include a lowpass response, a highpass response, a bandpass response, and a notch response. The filter may offer a variable slope which determines the rate of attenuation outside the bandpass, often at 6dB/octave, 12dB/octave (a '2 pole' filter) or 24dB/octave (a '4 pole' filter). This is also varied by the Q.

<DD>The Palmerston Forts are a group of forts and associated structures, around the coast of Britain. The forts were built during the Victorian period on the recommendations of the 1860 Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, following concerns about the strength of the French Navy,[1] and strenuous debate in Parliament about whether the cost could be justified.[2] The name comes from their association with Lord Palmerston, who was Prime Minister at the time and promoted the idea. The works were also known as Palmerston's Follies, partly because the first ones, around Portsmouth, had their main armament facing inland to protect Portsmouth from a land-based attack, which gave the impression that they faced the wrong way to defend from a French attack. They were also criticized because by the time they were completed, any threat had passed, largely due to the Franco-Prussian war of 1870,[3] and because the technology of the guns had become out-of-date. They were the most...

<DD>n 1859 Lord Palmerston instigated the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom because of serious concerns that France might attempt to invade the UK. The recent period had seen great improvements in gunnery (with RML and RBL designs); the widespread introduction of steam propulsion in ships (the French La Gloire and British response HMS Warrior are examples); and the growth of the French battle fleet (between 1854-1858 it had achieved numerical equality to the British). These factors convinced him that Britain's coastal defences were inadequate to prevent invasion by Napoleon III if the Royal Navy was lured elsewhere. The Commission consisted of six eminent naval and military officers, plus a civilian representative of the Treasury, James Fergusson, who in 1856-57 had published papers warning of the vulnerability of Portsmouth. Its brief was to enquire into the state and sufficiency of fortifications existing and planned for defending the UK, with a specific focus on...

<DD>No Man's Land Fort was a fort built in the Solent as part of the Palmerston Forts. It is 2.2 kilometres (1.4 mi) off the coast of the Isle of Wight and was built in the years 1867 to 1880 to protect Portsmouth. It was built at a cost of £462,500 which, adjusted for inflation, is equivalent to £43,391,356 at 2010 prices (approximately $73,000,000 US Dollars). No Man's Land Fort is almost identical to Horse Sand Fort. It has been used as a luxury home/hospitality centre for high-paying guests – due to the privacy it offers – with an indoor swimming pool and two helipads. In July 2004, Legionella bacteria found in the hotel's water system forced its closure. The Fort was put up for sale in 2005 and again in 2007, but the company collapsed.[3][4][5] In March 2008, Harmesh Pooni, claiming to still be the owner, barricaded himself inside the fort in protest against the administrators KPMG.

<DD>Horse Sand Fort is one of the larger Royal Commission sea forts in the Solent off Portsmouth, Hampshire, England. It is 73 metres (240 ft) across, built between 1865 and 1880, with two floors and a basement and armour-plated all round. The original armament was to have been 45 10-inch and 44 12.5-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns on the gun floors and 10 12" RMLs on the roof in five turrets. In fact the turrets were never built and the limited space meant the 12.5-inch guns had to be operated with less than full charges of powder. In 1882, 12-inch rifled breech-loading guns were placed in alternate bays. Horse Sand Fort was built on a ring of masonry consisting of large concrete blocks with an outer skin of granite blocks, the interior being filled with clay and shingle and covered with a thick layer of concrete. The lower foundation walls of the fort are 18 metres (59 ft) thick. The fort is split into three levels with the top measuring 62.4 metres (204 ft 9 in) in diameter.

The fort is one of four located in the Solent, near Portsmouth, England. Work on constructing the fort started in 1861 but was soon halted for a review into the best way to defend the Solent and approaches to Portsmouth Harbour. Work restarted in 1867 and was completed in 1878. Spitbank is smaller than the two main Solent forts, Horse Sand Fort and No Man's Land Fort. Its main purpose was as a further line of defence for ships that made it past the two main forts. It is 49.4 metres (162 ft) in diameter across at its base, with one floor and a basement and armour plating only on the seaward side. It was originally planned to have been armed with nine 10" eighteen ton rifled muzzle loader (RML) guns on the seaward side, and six 7" seven ton RML guns on the landward side.

The cryptographic operations behind the process often draw large amounts of power and produce lots of heat. People looking to acquire a large war chest of digital coins typically must pour large amounts of money and effort into the endeavor. One way malicious actors get by this requirement is by compromising large numbers of devices operated by other people. The devices then perform the work at the expense of the unsuspecting end users and pass on the proceeds to the attacker.

<DD>If you’ve travelled through a Canadian airport or U.S. border crossing in the past few years, you will have experienced the growing emphasis on security screening. The reality is that airports (and, to a lesser extent, sea ports and land border crossings) are different from most other public spaces in Canada. On the street, you would be understandably upset if police randomly demanded to examine your identification or subject you to searches. Travellers today are subject to greater scrutiny than ever before. At airports, security measures are presented as a trade-off for safer skies. But does that mean you have to check in your privacy rights with your luggage? Certainly not. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada has been working for many years to ensure that security measures at airports and border crossings do not unduly infringe on the privacy of Canadians.

<DD>In October 2013 frog founder Hartmut Esslinger will publish his new book Keep It Simple – The Early Design Years of Apple, an insider’s account of the origins of Apple’s iconic products and brand. “Keep It Simple” is the story of Steve Jobs’ quest in the early 1980s to bring a radically new design language to the historically desert-dry sensory experience of computer technology. This process started with the so-called “Snow White” project, a design competition won by frog. Eventually, Snow White would change the trajectory of the company’s future, and redefine the way we think about consumer electronics and technology today.

<DD>Active filters are great – if you need to reduce noise in your signal chain. But, what about the intrinsic noise that the filter’s resistors and amplifiers add to your signal path? We all know the uses of active filters. For instance, a low-pass filter can be used to attenuate noise above a designed-in frequency. You can use a high-pass filter to eliminate low-frequency signals and noise from your system. You also can utilize the bandpass filter in under sampling applications. Finally, the bandstop filter can reject mains frequencies, such as 50 or 60 Hz, or a power supply frequency. All of these filters are designed to eliminate or at least reduce noise in the signal path.

Alternate side parking usually operates in conjunction with permit parking regulations, where parking is allowed by permit only on one side of the street, and parking is prohibited at all times on the other side. The effective changeover time is 12 midnight in all areas. Along with the requirement to display the permit clearly, customers may use on-street parking only during the posted and permitted times/hours identified by signs on individual streets.

<DD>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is the collective name for a number of activities undertaken to search for intelligent extraterrestrial life. SETI projects use scientific methods in this search. For example, electromagnetic radiation is monitored for signs of transmissions from civilizations on other worlds. Some of the most well-known projects are run by Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley, or the SETI Institute. In 1995, the United States federal government ceased funding to SETI projects, forcing them to turn to private funding to continue the search, though in recent years, government funding of SETI has resumed at modest levels. There are great challenges in searching the cosmos for signs of intelligent life, including their identification and interpretation. SETI projects use the best available scientific knowledge to conduct experiments, which has traditionally led to searches for electromagnetic radiation emitted by adv

<DD>The Drake equation is a probabilistic argument used to estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy. The equation was written in 1961 by Frank Drake not for purposes of quantifying the number of civilizations, but intended as a way to stimulate scientific dialogue at the world's first SETI meeting, in Green Bank, West Virginia. The equation summarizes the main concepts which scientists must contemplate when considering the question of other radio-communicative life. The Drake equation has proved controversial since several of its factors are currently unknown, and estimates of their values span a very wide range. This has led critics to label the equation a guesstimate, or even meaningless.

<DD>Using a small isotropic crystalline whispering-gallery resonator, a group of Australian researchers has demonstrated the most precise room-temperature-range thermometer in existence; the device measures temperature to a precision of 3x10-8°C (a resolution of 80 nK/(Hz)0.5).1 The team includes members from the University of Western Australia (Crawley), University of Adelaide (Adelaide), University of Queensland (Brisbane), and Australian National University (Canberra). The approach is conceptually simple: prism-couple light of two different wavelengths into the resonator so that the mode frequency ratio is very close to 2 (±0.3 parts per million), and monitor the output. At the temperature changes, the frequency difference between the two modes changes. The approach takes advantage of the fact that the change in refractive index with respect to temperature is different for the two wavelengths (the researchers used red and green light).

<DD>We demonstrate thermometry with a resolution of 80  nK/Hz‾‾‾√ using an isotropic crystalline whispering-gallery mode resonator based on a dichroic dual-mode technique. We simultaneously excite two modes that have a mode frequency ratio that is very close to two (±0.3  ppm). The wavelength and temperature dependence of the refractive index means that the frequency difference between these modes is an ultrasensitive proxy of the resonator temperature. This approach to temperature sensing automatically suppresses sensitivity to thermal expansion and vibrationally induced changes of the resonator. We also demonstrate active suppression of temperature fluctuations in the resonator by controlling the intensity of the driving laser. The residual temperature fluctuations are shown to be below the limits set by fundamental thermodynamic fluctuations of the resonator material.

I’ll announce all of those here as they appear. I feel I owe an explanation for the long delay in publishing this book. I finished it in early January, about a week after my mother died, only to learn that my old-school book publisher didn’t want to touch it. Or more properly they wanted me to be entirely devoted to the book they were paying me a ton of money to write and to wait on IBM even though the eBook had been in the works for two years and was completely ready-to-go.

<DD>Benoît B. Mandelbrot (20 November 1924 – 14 October 2010) was a Polish-born, French and American mathematician, noted for developing a "theory of roughness" in nature and the field of fractal geometry to help prove it, which included coining the word "fractal". He later discovered the Mandelbrot set of intricate, never-ending fractal shapes, named in his honor. While he was a child, his family fled to France in 1936 to escape the growing Nazi persecution of Jews. After World War II ended in 1945, Mandelbrot studied mathematics, graduating from universities in Paris and the U.S., receiving a masters degree in aeronautics from Caltech. He spent most of his career in both the U.S. and France, having dual French and American citizenship. In 1958 he began working for IBM, where he stayed for 35 years and was an IBM Fellow.

<DD>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and distributed object management systems, through extension of its request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems to be built independently of the data being transferred. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].

It’s 176 pages of everything from the definitions of GET, POST and DELETE to how TCP connections should be managed, and it was put together by the original HTTP Working Group over a few years in the mid-to-late 90’s, when it became apparent that the Web was going to be Big. It turns out that it would become even bigger than was anticipated. People started using HTTP for things other than Web browsing (so-called “HTTP APIs”), and they began using the Web itself in new ways, with the advent of AJAX and later HTML5. As a result, lots of questions started popping up about what the RFC means; since it was written for the “old” Web, lots of situations weren’t thought of, and needed clarification. And, like many consensus documents, it wasn’t clearly written down in...

<DD>On-board diagnostics (OBD) is an automotive term referring to a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD systems give the vehicle owner or repair technician access to the status of the various vehicle sub-systems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s' versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or "idiot light" if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as to the nature of the problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.

<DD>CAN bus (for controller area network) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other within a vehicle without a host computer. CAN bus is a message-based protocol, designed specifically for automotive applications but now also used in other areas such as aerospace, maritime, industrial automation and medical equipment. Development of the CAN bus started originally in 1983 at Robert Bosch GmbH. The protocol was officially released in 1986 at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) congress in Detroit, Michigan. The first CAN controller chips, produced by Intel and Philips, came on the market in 1987. Bosch published the CAN 2.0 specification in 1991. In 2012 Bosch has specified the improved CAN data link layer protocol, called CAN FD, which will extend the ISO 11898-1. CAN bus is one of five protocols used in the on-board diagnostics (OBD)-II vehicle diagnostics standard.

<DD>Nikola Tesla (Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла; 10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. Tesla gained experience in telephony and electrical engineering before emigrating to the United States in 1884 to work for Thomas Edison in New York City. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories and companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC induction motor and transformer were licensed by George Westinghouse, who also hired Tesla for a short time as a consultant. Tesla went on to pursue his ideas of wireless lighting and electricity distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs and made early (1893) pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices.

<DD>THE IDEA of communicating with the inhabitants of other worlds is an old one. But for ages it has been regarded merely as a poet's dream, forever unrealizable. And with the invention and perfection of the telescope and the ever-widening knowledge of the heavens, its hold upon our imaginations has been increased, and the scientific achievements during the latter part of the nineteenth century, together with the development of the tendency toward the nature ideal of Goethe, have intensified it to such a degree that it seems as if it were destined to become the dominating idea of the century that has just begun. The desire to know something of our neighbors in the immense depths of space does not spring from idle curiosity nor from thirst for knowledge, but from a deeper cause, and it is a feeling firmly rooted in the heart of every human being capable of thinking at all.

Athough Tesla used different parts, this radio's basic L-C (Inductor-Capacitor) circuit uses a similar schematic to what Tesla experimented with in his early days. The versatile 1N34A crystal germanium diode used here, substitutes for the tricky rotating nickel detectors and sensitive relays, used by Tesla in the late 1800's. You can listen to AM broadcasts with this radio, but it was made to have fun with in other ways. (Besides, AM radio wasn't exactly what Nikola Tesla was interested in...in fact, he believed it was a waste of energy to transmit and receive Hertzian waves!)

<DD>A fractal antenna is an antenna that uses a fractal, self-similar design to maximize the length, or increase the perimeter (on inside sections or the outer structure), of material that can receive or transmit electromagnetic radiation within a given total surface area or volume. Such fractal antennas are also referred to as multilevel and space filling curves, but the key aspect lies in their repetition of a motif over two or more scale sizes, or "iterations". For this reason, fractal antennas are very compact, multiband or wideband, and have useful applications in cellular telephone and microwave communications. A good example of a fractal antenna as a spacefilling curve is in the form of a shrunken fractal helix. Here, each line of copper is just a small fraction of a wavelength.

Faced with the prospect of further public scrutiny and accountability, the UK Government gave the Guardian newspaper an ultimatum: hand over the classified documents or destroy them.

<DD>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (/ˈniːtʃə/[42] or /ˈnitʃi/;[43] German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈniːt͡sʃə]; 15 October 1844 – 25 August 1900) was a German philologist, philosopher, cultural critic, poet and composer.

<DD>In philosophy, the theory of materialism holds that all things are composed of material, and that all emergent phenomena (including consciousness) are the result of material properties and interactions. In other words, the theory claims that our reality consists entirely of physical matter that is the sole cause of every possible occurrence, including human thought, feeling, and action. Materialism is typically considered to be closely related to physicalism; although, to some philosophers, materialism is synonymous with physicalism. Contrasting philosophies include idealism and other forms of monism, dualism, and pluralism.

<DD>Socialism is a social and economic system characterised by social ownership of the means of production and co-operative management of the economy, as well as a political theory and movement that aims at the establishment of such a system. "Social ownership" may refer to cooperative enterprises, common ownership, state ownership, citizen ownership of equity, or any combination of these. There are many varieties of socialism and there is no single definition encapsulating all of them. They differ in the type of social ownership they advocate, the degree to which they rely on markets or planning, how management is to be organised within productive institutions, and the role of the state in constructing socialism.

<DD>Communism (from Latin communis – common, universal) is a socioeconomic system structured upon common ownership of the means of production and characterised by the absence of classes, money, and the state; as well as a social, political and economic ideology and movement that aims to establish this social order. The movement to develop communism, in its Marxist–Leninist interpretations, significantly influenced the history of the 20th century, which saw intense rivalry between the Communist states in the Eastern bloc and the most developed capitalist states of the Western world.

Marx's work in economics laid the basis for the current understanding of labour and its relation to capital, and has influenced much of subsequent economic thought.[4][5][6][7] He published numerous books during his lifetime, the most notable being The Communist Manifesto (1848) and Das Kapital (1867–1894).

I was with them for the last three to twelve weeks of their lives. People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality. I learnt never to underestimate someone’s capacity for growth. Some changes were phenomenal. Each experienced a variety of emotions, as expected, denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually acceptance. Every single patient found their peace before they departed though, every one of them.

<DD>In older video cameras, before the mid to late 1980s, a video camera tube or pickup tube was used instead of a charge-coupled device (CCD) for converting an optical image into an electrical signal. Several types were in use from the 1930s to the 1980s. The most commercially successful of these tubes were various types of cathode ray tubes or "CRTs". Any vacuum tube which operates using a focused beam of electrons ("cathode rays") is known as a cathode ray tube. However, in the popular lexicon "CRT" usually refers to the "picture tube" in a television or computer monitor. The proper term for this type of display tube is kinescope, only one of many types of cathode ray tubes. Others include the tubes used in oscilloscopes, radar displays, and the camera pickup tubes described in this article.[1] (The word "kinescope" has also become the popular name for a film recording made by focusing a motion picture camera onto the face of a kinescope cathode ray tube, a common practice before...

<DD>Take a tour through the research laboratories at any university physics department or national lab, and much of what you will see defines “cutting edge.” “Research,” after all, means seeing what has never been seen before—looking deeper, measuring more precisely, thinking about problems in new ways. A large research project in the physical sciences usually involves experimenters, theorists, and people carrying out calculations with computers. There are computers and terminals everywhere. Some of the people hunched over these screens are writing papers, some are analyzing data, and some are working on simulations.

Adding geo data is a way for our members to organize their memories (that trip we took to Europe last year) and share their experiences with other members. Today, we’ve added an easy-peasy way of adding geo data without having to leave the comfort of your own photo page. On the right side of your photo, click the three-circles icon and you’ll see “Add to your map” link in the pop-up menu, it’ll open a map which you can literally pin your photo on.

<DD>Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott. Writing pseudonymously as "A Square", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to offer pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions. Several films have been made from the story, including a feature film in 2007 called Flatland. Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and the short films Flatland: The Movie and Flatland 2: Sphereland starring Martin Sheen and Kristen Bell.

He helped found or develop countless household-name technologies and companies in the time it takes most people finish college. Aaron was a pioneer in Internet activism, and stood at the forefront of the SOPA and PIPA victories. He looked towards a limitless future—but his life took a dramatic turn. In 2011 and 2012, he was indicted by prosecutors who charged him with a staggering number of felonies. Aaron found himself facing 35 years in prison, and at the age of 26 was found dead in his apartment, from an apparent suicide. As we hear from those closest to Aaron, this incredibly inspirational and moving story shows how one of the most promising minds of a generation found himself staring down a government prosecuting him under the very laws he was fighting against.

You need a password for the Windows network logon, your e-mail account, your website's FTP password, online passwords (like website member account), etc. etc. etc. The list is endless. Also, you should use different passwords for each account. Because if you use only one password everywhere and someone gets this password you have a problem... A serious problem. The thief would have access to your e-mail account, website, etc. Unimaginable. KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known (AES and Twofish). For more information, see the features page.

<DD>People have been building complex software for over sixty years, but until recently, only a handful of researchers had studied how it was actually done. Many people had opinions—often very strong ones—but most of these were based on personal anecdotes, or on the kind of "it's obvious" reasoning that led Aristotle to conclude that heavy objects fall faster than light ones. To make matters worse, many of the studies that were done were crippled by lack of generality, artificiality, or small sample sizes. As a result, while software engineering billed itself as a "hard" science, rigor was much less common than in "soft" disciplines like marketing, which has gone from the gut instincts of Mad Men to being a quantitative, analytic discipline.

The Extra-Terrestrial, a video game so bad that burying it in the New Mexico desert seemed the best way to move on. But now, the Atari graveyard has been exhumed, and the latest attempt to find the cache of game cartridges has been declared a success. Helped by heavy machinery, a crew found some of the games today, in a dig that inspired the Twitter hashtag .

<DD>Scientists use many techniques to study natural habitats, but they rarely listen to nature. To some biologists, sounds are more than an aural accompaniment to field trips: They convey information that traditional field surveys are hard-pressed to uncover. Now scientists are using sounds to tap into the pulse of ecosystems and monitor their health.

It was also used to help students, technicians and engineers understand how to repair faulty microprocessor-based systems. Mounted in a brief case, the HP 5036A provided both the hardware and software basics and vital troubleshooting information needed to solve hardware problems. The board held a 8085A CPU, 2 KB ROM and 1 KB RAM. Displays for the Address/Register/Data were 6 digit, 7-segment LED displays. Output port had 8 LED's, one for each line. Address bus had 16 LED's, one per line. Status lines had 6 LED's; one per line. I/O's 8-bit latched output port with LED indicators, and 8-bit input port with DIP switch. Several DIP switch were used to disconnect MPU data lines from data bus, select test loop program or run a program in test mode. Twelve user-programmable fault jumpers on circuit board simulated various hardware faults.

<DD>Ralph Nelson Elliott (28 July 1871–15 January 1948) was an American accountant and author, whose study of stock market data led him to develop the Wave Principle, a form of technical analysis that identifies trends in the financial markets. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call Elliott waves.

<DD>The random walk hypothesis is a financial theory stating that stock market prices evolve according to a random walk and thus cannot be predicted. It is consistent with the efficient-market hypothesis. The concept can be traced to French broker Jules Regnault who published a book in 1863, and then to French mathematician Louis Bachelier whose Ph.D. dissertation titled "The Theory of Speculation" (1900) included some remarkable insights and commentary. The same ideas were later developed by MIT Sloan School of Management professor Paul Cootner in his 1964 book The Random Character of Stock Market Prices. The term was popularized by the 1973 book, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, by Burton Malkiel, a Professor of Economics at Princeton University, and was used earlier in Eugene Fama's 1965 article "Random Walks In Stock Market Prices",[3] which was a less technical version of his Ph.D. thesis.

<DD>In finance, the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), or the joint hypothesis problem, asserts that financial markets are "informationally efficient". In consequence of this, one cannot consistently achieve returns in excess of average market returns on a risk-adjusted basis, given the information available at the time the investment is made. There are three major versions of the hypothesis: "weak", "semi-strong", and "strong". The weak form of the EMH claims that prices on traded assets (e.g., stocks, bonds, or property) already reflect all past publicly available information. The semi-strong form of the EMH claims both that prices reflect all publicly available information and that prices instantly change to reflect new public information. The strong form of the EMH additionally claims that prices instantly reflect even hidden or "insider" information. Critics have blamed the belief in rational markets for much of the late-2000s financial crisis.

<DD>In finance, Fibonacci retracement is a method of technical analysis for determining support and resistance levels. They are named after their use of the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci retracement is based on the idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction. The appearance of retracement can be ascribed to ordinary price volatility as described by Burton Malkiel, a Princeton economist in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, who found no reliable predictions in technical analysis methods taken as a whole. Malkiel argues that asset prices typically exhibit signs of random walk and that one cannot consistently outperform market averages. Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move.

<DD>Leonardo Pisano Bigollo (c. 1170 – c. 1250) – known as Fibonacci, and also Leonardo of Pisa, Leonardo Pisano, Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo Fibonacci – was an Italian mathematician, considered by some "the most talented western mathematician of the Middle Ages." Fibonacci is best known to the modern world for the spreading of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system in Europe, primarily through his composition in 1202 of Liber Abaci (Book of Calculation), and for a number sequence named the Fibonacci numbers after him, which he did not discover but used as an example in the Liber Abaci.

<DD>In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers or Fibonacci series or Fibonacci sequence are the numbers in the following integer sequence:[1][2] 1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\; \ldots\; or (often, in modern usage): 0,\;1,\;1,\;2,\;3,\;5,\;8,\;13,\;21,\;34,\;55,\;89,\;144,\; \ldots\; (sequence A000045 in OEIS) By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

<DD>The Elliott wave principle is a form of technical analysis that some traders use to analyze financial market cycles and forecast market trends by identifying extremes in investor psychology, highs and lows in prices, and other collective factors. Ralph Nelson Elliott (1871–1948), a professional accountant, discovered the underlying social principles and developed the analytical tools in the 1930s. He proposed that market prices unfold in specific patterns, which practitioners today call Elliott waves, or simply waves. Elliott published his theory of market behavior in the book The Wave Principle in 1938, summarized it in a series of articles in Financial World magazine in 1939, and covered it most comprehensively in his final major work, Nature’s Laws: The Secret of the Universe in 1946. Elliott stated that "because man is subject to rhythmical procedure, calculations having to do with his activities can be projected far into the future with a justification and certainty heretofore...

<DD>Graphene has extremely low mass density and high mechanical strength, key qualities for efficient wide-frequency-response electrostatic audio speaker design. Low mass ensures good high frequency response, while high strength allows for relatively large free-standing diaphragms necessary for effective low frequency response. Here we report on construction and testing of a miniaturized graphene-based electrostatic audio transducer. The speaker/earphone is straightforward in design and operation and has excellent frequency response across the entire audio frequency range (20HZ - 20kHz), with performance matching or surpassing commercially available audio earphones.

The Nekoma Pyramid was a missile site radar complex, used to locate missiles fired from foreign powers at the USA so that they could be destroyed. The base was armed with 30 Spartan anti-ballistic missiles with thermonuclear warheads and sixteen short-range Sprint missiles.

<DD>Time accuracy superior to telephone time accuracy is available throughout Canada and in many other parts of the world by means of NRC's radio time signals broadcast continuously from short wave radio station CHU. If corrections are made for the propagation delay from CHU to the user, and for delays in the user's receiver, an accuracy of better than 1 ms can be obtained. Signal availability at a user's location depends on ionospheric conditions. CHU also broadcasts a time code which can be decoded with common computers and modems. Three frequencies are used: 3330, 7850, and 14 670 kHz. The transmission mode, upper single sideband with carrier re-inserted, provides time signal service without requiring a special SSB radio, and also provides three standard frequencies. The frequencies are derived from one of a trio of closely synchronized atomic clocks located at the transmitter site. Three clocks are employed to permit majority logic checking.

<DD>The National Security Agency’s sophisticated hacking operations go way beyond using software vulnerabilities to gain access to targeted systems. The agency has a catalog of tools available that would make James Bond’s Q jealous, providing NSA analysts access to just about every potential source of data about a target. In some cases, the NSA has modified the firmware of computers and network hardware—including systems shipped by Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, and Juniper Networks—to give its operators both eyes and ears inside the offices the agency has targeted. In others, the NSA has crafted custom BIOS exploits that can survive even the reinstallation of operating systems. And in still others, the NSA has built and deployed its own USB cables at target locations—complete with spy hardware and radio transceiver packed inside.

<DD>This I2C digital temperature sensor is one of the more accurate/precise we've ever seen, with a typical accuracy of ±0.25°C over the sensor's -40°C to +125°C range and precision of +0.0625°C. They work great with any microcontroller using standard i2c. There are 3 address pins so you can connect up to 8 to a single I2C bus without address collisions. Best of all, a wide voltage range makes is usable with 2.7V to 5.5V logic! Unlike the DS18B20, this sensor does not come in through-hole package so we placed this small sensor on a breakout board PCB for easy use. The PCB includes mounting holes, and pull down resistors for the 3 address pins.

<DD>A Canadian mourning the loss of her friend caught what will likely be one of the Major League Baseball season's most historic home run balls, during a recent game at Detroit's Comerica Park. Ally McCabe, and nearly 150 other friends and family were at Comerica celebrating the life of a friend and huge Tigers fan who recently died. While at the early-season game, she caught a historic Miguel Cabrera home run ball. It was the 2,000th hit of the slugger's career, which will likely land him in the Hall of Fame. McCabe, from LaSalle, Ont., just west of Windsor, had never been to a ball game. She was at Comerica on Friday as part of an extended funeral for lifelong Tigers fan Robert Lucier. Lucier's sons, Rob and Chris, planned the trip.

I do prefer the interactions and sound quality of using real instruments and that is something that you just can not get with a computer. The analog synths can change in their characteristics day to day based on the temperature and their components. They also allow the ability to cross patch and communicate together over control voltage that inspires me to make sounds I have not been able to get to digitally. On the Other hand digital synthesizers like the Waldorf, PPG Wave, Synclavier and Emulators also offer up sounds that compliment the analog synths.

<DD>A nuclear and radiation accident is defined by the International Atomic Energy Agency as "an event that has led to significant consequences to people, the environment or the facility." Examples include lethal effects to individuals, large radioactivity release to the environment, or reactor core melt." The prime example of a "major nuclear accident" is one in which a reactor core is damaged and significant amounts of radioactivity are released, such as in the Chernobyl Disaster in 1986. The impact of nuclear accidents has been a topic of debate practically since the first nuclear reactors were constructed in 1954. It has also been a key factor in public concern about nuclear facilities. Some technical measures to reduce the risk of accidents or to minimize the amount of radioactivity released to the environment have been adopted. Despite the use of such measures, "there have been many accidents with varying impacts as well near misses and incidents".

<DD>A scram or SCRAM is an emergency shutdown of a nuclear reactor – though the term has been extended to cover shutdowns of other complex operations, such as server farms and even large model railroads (see Tech Model Railroad Club). In commercial reactor operations, this emergency shutdown is often referred to as a "SCRAM" at boiling water reactors (BWR), and as a "reactor trip" at pressurized water reactors (PWR). In many cases, a SCRAM is part of the routine shutdown procedure as well. The term is usually cited as being an acronym for safety cut rope axe man, which was coined by Enrico Fermi when the world's first nuclear reactor was built under the bleachers at the University of Chicago's Stagg Field.

<DD>The Black Sea Fleet (Russian: Черноморский Флот, Chernomorsky Flot) is a large operational-strategic sub-unit of the Russian (and formerly Soviet) Navy, operating in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea since the late 18th century. Its ships are based in various harbors of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, while its aviation and infrastructure is based in various locations in Crimea, Ukraine and Krasnodar Krai, Russia.

<DD>In 1953, Joseph Stalin signed the plans for a top-secret nuclear submarine base that would become the operational home for the fearsome Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Hidden inside the base of a mountain in the port town of Balaklava on Ukraine’s Crimean coast, the 153,000 square-foot facility took nine years to build and its entrance camouflaged from spy planes. It could survive a direct nuclear hit and at maximum capacity could hold 3,000 people with supplies to sustain them for a month. Best of all, the vast subs that slunk in and out of here between tours of duty could enter and leave underwater, keeping them from prying eyes at all times.

In the comments, I was asked why in the heck I would even consider doing such a thing (as opposed to sticking with binary representations). Well, the answer is along the lines of "We are base-10 creatures living in a base-10 world." Much of what we do is related to the decimal system, so we often find the need to multiply and divide by 10. Let's figure out some ways to do it quickly and efficiently. Sometimes this can lead to things that work better in the base-2 world of numerical machines.

<DD>FR-4 (or FR4) is a grade designation assigned to glass-reinforced epoxy laminate sheets, tubes, rods and printed circuit boards (PCB). FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant (self-extinguishing). "FR" stands for flame retardant, and denotes that safety of flamability of FR-4 is in compliance with the standard UL94V-0. FR-4 is created from the constituent materials (epoxy resin, woven glass fabric reinforcement, brominated flame retardant, etc.) by NEMA in 1968. FR-4 glass epoxy is a popular and versatile high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate grade with good strength to weight ratios. With near zero water absorption, FR-4 is most commonly used as an electrical insulator possessing considerable mechanical strength. The material is known to retain its high mechanical values and electrical insulating qualities in both dry and humid conditions. These attributes, along with good fabrication characteristics, lend

This brings me to my topic today – high performance serialized bus standards.

<DD>In 1854, Daniel McCallum took charge of the operations of the New York and Erie Railroad. With nearly 500 miles of track, it was one of the world’s longest systems, but not one of the most efficient. In fact, McCallum found that far from rendering operations more efficient, the scale of the railroad exponentially increased its complexity. The problem was not a lack of information: the growing use of the telegraph gave the company an unprecedented supply of nearly real-time data, including reports of accidents and train delays. Rather, the difficulty was putting that data to use, and it led McCallum to develop one of the era’s great low-tech management innovations: the organization chart. This article presents that long-lost chart (see sidebar, “Tracking a missing org chart”) and shows how aligning data with operations and strategy—the quintessential modern management challenge—is a problem that spans the ages.

<DD>Look at most of organizational charts today and you’ll see the standard top-down pyramid flowing linearly from the big dog down to lower-level managers and minions. But the first modern-day organizational chart wasn’t made to remind lower-level employees who they really work for. No, one of the first company-wide organizational charts was actually a 19th century invention of necessity. Back in the mid-1800s, the Erie Railroad was a thriving but disorganized company responsible for transporting goods throughout the Northeast. The railroad company had more than 500 miles of track, making it one of the largest of its time. This was good for business, but bad for organization. Today we deal with inconceivably large amounts of data that is made comprehensible only by modern technology. Back in the 19th century, big data meant something entirely different, but managing it was as vital then as it is today.

<DD>The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is the thermal radiation assumed to be left over from the "Big Bang" of cosmology. In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation." The CMB is a cosmic background radiation that is fundamental to observational cosmology because it is the oldest light in the universe, dating to the epoch of recombination. With a traditional optical telescope, the space between stars and galaxies (the background) is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive radio telescope shows a faint background glow, almost exactly the same in all directions, that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the microwave region of the radio spectrum. The CMB's serendipitous discovery in 1964 by American radio astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, and earned the discoverers the 1978 Nobel Prize.

Astronomers have likened the CMB to seeing sunlight penetrating an overcast sky.

What they detected is known as primordial B-mode polarization and is important for at least two reasons. It would be is the first detection of gravitational waves, which are predicted to exist under Einstein’s theory of relativity but have never before been seen. But the thing that has scientists really excited is that it could provide the first direct evidence for a theorized event called inflation that caused the universe to exponentially grow just a fraction of a fraction of a second after it was born.

Other, less well-typed code will be translated to Python C-API calls effectively removing the "interpreter" but not removing the dynamic indirection. Numba is also not a tracing jit. It compiles your code before it gets run either using run-time type information or type information you provide in the decorator. Numba is a mechanism for producing machine code from Python syntax and typed data structures such as those that exist in NumPy.

She withdrew from this scene in the early 1980s, believing that its focus had shifted from artistic process to product. While she continues to support herself through software development, Spiegel aims to use technology in music as a means of furthering her art rather than as an end in itself. In her words, "I automate whatever can be automated to be freer to focus on those aspects of music that can't be automated. The challenge is to figure out which is which."

<DD>In the hours after Newsweek claimed to have discovered the identity of the mystery-shrouded creator of the bitcoin cryptocurrency — pointing fingers at a 64-year-old retired engineer named Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto — a gaggle of reporters showed up on the man’s lawn in Southern California. And when he hopped into a blue Toyota Prius with one reporter, the rest of them piled into their own cars and chased him through the streets of downtown Los Angeles, desperate to get the story behind the myth of bitcoin’s founding father.

<DD>After a bizarre media scrum and brief car chase, the man identified this morning as the creator of bitcoin by Newsweek magazine has denied that he was involved with the digital currency, according to reports. Via Twitter, Los Angeles Times reporter Andrea Chang says she confronted the man — identified as 64-year-old Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto — at a sushi restaurant near his home in a Los Angeles suburbs and later at the Associated Press L.A. bureau. “I spoke with him at the restaurant and in the elevator at the AP. Denies everything,” she writes. “Told me in elevator that he’s not involved with #Bitcoin.”

<DD>The creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, may have been identified. Since a plan for the digital currency first showed up on an internet discussion forum dedicated to cryptography in 2008, those in the ever-expanding bitcoin community — not to mention the mass media — have sought the identity of its creator, who had called himself Satoshi Nakamoto on the forum but soon disappeared from view. Many assumed that the name was a pseudonym, and some speculated that Nakamoto was in fact multiple people working in concert. As it turns out, according to a story from Newsweek‘s Leah McGrath Goodman, his name is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto — though he went by the first name Dorian — and he is a 64-year-old Japanese American living near Los Angeles.

His hair is unkempt, and he has the thousand-mile stare of someone who has gone weeks without sleep. He stands not with defiance, but with the slackness of a person who has waged battle for a long time and now faces a grave loss.

<DD>In 1963 Edward Lorenz published his famous set of coupled nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations; they are relatively simple, but the resulting behavior is wonderfully complex. The equations are: dx/dt = s(y-x) dy/dt = rx-y-xz dz/dt = xy - bz with suggested parameters s=10, r=28, and b=8/3. The solution executes a trajectory, plotted in three dimensions, that winds around and around, neither predictable nor random, occupying a region known as its attractor. With lots of computing power you can approximate the equations numerically, and many handsome plots can be found on the web. However, it's rather easy to implement these equations in an analog electronic circuit, with just 3 op-amps (each does both an integration and a sum) and two analog multipliers (to form the products xy and xz).

<DD>A train wheel or rail wheel is a type of wheel specially designed for use on rail tracks. A rolling component is typically pressed onto an axle and mounted directly on a rail car or locomotive or indirectly on a bogie, also called a truck. Wheels are cast or forged (wrought) and are heat treated to have a specific hardness. New wheels are trued, using a lathe, to a specific profile before being pressed onto an axle. All wheel profiles need to be periodically monitored to insure proper wheel-rail interface. Improperly trued wheels increase rolling resistance, reduce energy efficiency and may create unsafe operation. A railroad wheel typically consists of two main parts: the wheel itself, and the tire (or tyre) around the outside.

<DD>We spend the hour with Joshua Oppenheimer, the director of a groundbreaking new documentary called "The Act of Killing." The film is set in Indonesia, where, beginning in 1965, military and paramilitary forces slaughtered up to a million Indonesians after overthrowing the democratically elected government. That military was backed by the United States and led by General Suharto, who would rule Indonesia for decades. There has been no truth and reconciliation commission, nor have any of the murderers been brought to justice. As the film reveals, Indonesia is a country where the killers are to this day celebrated as heroes by many. Oppenheimer spent more than eight years interviewing the Indonesian death squad leaders, and in "The Act of Killing," he works with them to re-enact the real-life killings in the style of American movies in which the men love to watch — this includes classic Hollywood gangster movies and lavish musical numbers. A key figure he follows is Anwar Congo...

<DD>The siemens (SI unit symbol: S) is the unit of electric conductance and electric admittance in the International System of Units (SI). Conductance and admittance are the reciprocals of resistance and impedance respectively, hence one siemens is equal to the reciprocal of one ohm, and is also referred to as the mho. The 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures approved the addition of the siemens as a derived unit in 1971. The unit is named after Ernst Werner von Siemens. As with every SI unit whose name is derived from the proper name of a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (S); the lower-case "s" is the symbol for the second. When an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower-case letter (siemens), except where any word would be capitalized. In English, the same form siemens is used both for the singular and plural.

<DD>A cytokine storm is the systemic expression of a healthy and vigorous immune system resulting in the release of more than 150 inflammatory mediators (cytokines, oxygen free radicals, and coagulation factors). Both pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, InterLeukin-1, and InterLeukin-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin 10, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) are elevated in the serum, and the fierce and often lethal interplay of these cytokines is referred to as a "Cytokine Storm". The primary contributors to the cytokine storm are TNF-a (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha) and IL-6 (Interleukin-6). The cytokine storm is an inappropriate (exaggerated) immune response that is caused by rapidly proliferating and highly activated T-cells or natural killer (NK) cells. These cells are themselves activated by infected macrophages. The cytokine storm must be treated and suppressed or lethality can result.

<DD>A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator originating from the cyclotron in which the guiding magnetic field (bending the particles into a closed path) is time-dependent, being synchronized to a particle beam of increasing kinetic energy. The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts to enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron in 1945, although Vladimir Veksler had already (unknown to McMillan) published the principle in a Soviet journal in 1944. The first proton synchrotron was designed by Sir Marcus Oliphant and built in 1952.

<DD>The Synchrophasotron was a synchrotron-based particle accelerator for protons at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna that was operational from 1957 to 2003. It was designed and constructed under supervision of Vladimir Veksler, who had invented the synchrotron in independence to Edwin McMillan. Its final energy for protons, and later deuterium nuclei, was 10 GeV.

<DD>A current mirror is a circuit designed to copy a current through one active device by controlling the current in another active device of a circuit, keeping the output current constant regardless of loading. The current being 'copied' can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal inverting current amplifier that reverses the current direction as well or it is a current-controlled current source (CCCS). The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits.

<DD>In Part 1 of this mini-series we introduced the concept that any manufactured product should be tested. Of course, a key aspect to testing is controlling the test. There are numerous approaches to creating the circuitry required to test any board. It is vital to remember that the test equipment documentation is as important as the product itself. The product life cycle can extend beyond expectations. Test jigs are shipped back and forth to subcontractors, stacked on shelves, and abused in many other ways (sometimes intentionally), so they have to be rugged.

<DD>The Northrop YB-49 was a prototype jet-powered heavy bomber aircraft developed by Northrop Corporation shortly after World War II for service with the U.S. Air Force. The YB-49 featured a flying wing design and was a jet-powered development of the earlier, piston-engined Northrop XB-35 and YB-35. The two YB-49s actually built were both converted YB-35 test aircraft. The YB-49 never entered production, being passed over in favor of the more conventional Convair B-36 piston-driven design. Design work performed in the development of the YB-35 and YB-49 nonetheless proved to be valuable to Northrop decades later in the eventual development of the B-2 stealth bomber, which entered service in the early 1990s.

<DD>The Northrop XB-35 and YB-35 were experimental heavy bomber aircraft developed by the Northrop Corporation for the United States Army Air Forces during and shortly after World War II. The airplane used the radical and potentially very efficient flying wing design, in which the tail section and fuselage are eliminated and all payload is carried in a thick wing. Only prototype and pre-production aircraft were built, although interest remained strong enough to warrant further development of the design as a jet bomber, under the designation YB-49.

<DD>Liquid Sky is an independent American science fiction film. It debuted at the Montreal Film festival in August 1982 and was well received at several film festivals thereafter. It was produced with a budget of $500,000. It became the most successful independent film of 1983 grossing $1.7 million in the first several months of release. The film is seen as heavily influencing a club scene that emerged in the early 2000s in Brooklyn, Berlin and London called electroclash.

<DD>Invisible aliens in a tiny flying saucer come to Earth looking for heroin. They land on top of a New York apartment inhabited by a drug dealer and her female, androgynous, bisexual nymphomaniac lover, a fashion model. The aliens soon find the human pheromones created in the brain during orgasm preferable to heroin, and the model's casual sex partners begin to disappear. This increasingly bizarre scenario is observed by a lonely woman in the building across the street, a German scientist who is following the aliens, and an equally androgynous, drug-addicted male model. (Both models are played by Anne Carlisle, in a dual role.) Darkly funny and thoroughly weird.

<DD>Liquid Sky is one of the most visually ambitious films ever made about fashion, heroin, New Wave clubs, UFO saucers, ordering Chinese food and having them put it on your tab, the Empire State Building, androgyny, neon and tin foil. The 1982 cult classic may be the perfect embodiment of camp. Unlike contemporary low-budget cinema, which prizes an aesthetic of apathy, Liquid Sky makes its efforts visible. Judgmental fashion reporters cackle straight into the camera. Catwalk scenes take place in rooms both comically small and accurately sized to real New York spaces. And the slang-heavy dialogue, which the director Slava Tsukerman credits largely to the main actress and co-screenwriter Anne Carlisle, is bold and delightfully stilted.

The latest feat, achieved at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, is still a way off from the much harder and long-sought goal of 'ignition', the break-even point beyond which a fusion reactor can generate more energy than is put in. Many other steps in the current experiments dissipate energy before it even reaches the nuclear fuel.

<DD>An Object Modeling Language is a standardized set of symbols used to model a software system using an object-oriented framework. The symbols can be either informal or formal ranging from predefined graphical templates to formal object models defined by grammars and specifications. A modeling language is usually associated with a methodology for object-oriented development. The modeling language defines the elements of the model. E.g., that a model has classes, methods, object properties, etc. The methodology defines the steps developers and users need to take to develop and maintain a software system. Steps such as Define requirements, Develop code, and Test system.

The name was changed to Frogdesign in 1982 (the name apparently originating from an acronym for Esslinger's home country, the Federal Republic of Germany), then to Frog Design in 2000, and finally to frog in 2011.

<DD>The Snow White design language was an industrial design language developed by Hartmut Esslinger's Frog Design. Used by Apple Computer from 1984 to 1990, the scheme has vertical and horizontal stripes for decoration, ventilation, and the illusion that the computer enclosure is smaller than it actually is. The design language boosted Apple’s global reputation, set design trends for the computer industry, and molded the perception of computers in the manufacturing and business world. Among other design features, Esslinger's presentation of the Apple logo—a three-dimensional logo inlaid into the product case with the product name printed onto its surface—was included on nearly every product for several years.

It's data we hope will be especially helpful for new computer sciences graduates or coders looking to stay ahead of the curve. For the third year in a row, Python retains it's #1 dominance followed by Java, C++, and Javascript. This year's most noticeable changes were a 300% increase in Objective-C submissions, a 100% surge in C#, as well as a 33% increase in Javascript submissions while PHP lost -55%, Perl dropped -16%, and Java shrank -14%.

<DD>In 1961, Caltech took a leap of faith and invited Richard Feynman — champion of scientific culture, graphic novel hero, crusader for integrity, holder of the key to science — to teach the introductory course in physics. At the time, Feynman was a theoretical physicist with no particular interest in students — but he soon proved to be nothing short of an enchanter of the classroom. Feynman earned himself the moniker “the Great Explainer” and his lectures went on to become a cultural classic, blending brilliant yet accessible explanations of science with poignant meditations on life’s most profound questions. They were eventually collected in The Feynman Lectures on Physics (public library) — the same indispensable intellectual treat that gave us Feynman on the one sentence to be passed on to the next generation.

Lang's work have been represented in exhibitions and installations for more then a decade. After completing his certificate in electrical skills in 1994, he began creating experimental mechanical sound objects presenting them in the form of live performances / installations at various European and North America art spaces and festivals, including the Transmediale in Berlin, ISEA Singapore, sonicActs Amsterdam or the Elektra Festival in Montreal. From 2005 to 2008, these sound objects where exhibited as part of a collaborative project under the title "Untitled Sound Objects.

<DD>Using simple and functional components, Zimoun builds architecturally-minded platforms of sound. Exploring mechanical rhythm and flow in prepared systems, his installations incorporate commonplace industrial objects. In an obsessive display of simple and functional materials, these works articulate a tension between the orderly patterns of Modernism and the chaotic forces of life. Carrying an emotional depth, the acoustic hum of natural phenomena in Zimoun's minimalist constructions effortlessly reverberates. Zimoun, born in Switzerland in 1977, lives and works in Bern. His work has been presented in solo and group shows as well as performances wolrdwide. Zimoun has been awarded different art prizes and residencies and has served as a guest lecturer.

<DD>After Michael Mann set out to direct Collateral, the story’s setting moved from New York to Los Angeles. This decision was in part motivated by the unique visual presence of the city — especially the way it looked at night. Mann shot a majority of the film in HD (this was 2004), feeling the format better captured the city’s night lighting. Even the film’s protagonist taxi needed a custom coat to pick up different sheens depending on the type of artificial lighting the cab passed beneath. That city, at least as it appears in Collateral and countless other films, will never be the same again. L.A. has made a vast change-over to LED street lights, with New York City not far behind. Read on for why Hollywood will never look the same again — on film or otherwise.

<DD>Build a real MS-20 with your own hands – Creating an instrument your own hands is the part of the true enjoyment of an analog synthesizer. The MS-20 Kit lets you obtain a real, full-sized MS-20 by assembling it yourself. It goes without saying that, just like the MS-20 mini released in January 2013, the engineers who developed the original MS-20 have overseen this project - ensuring that its historic sound is reproduced with complete fidelity. In addition, the MS-20 Kit provides the filters from both the early and late versions of this classic instrument and it even allows you to switch between them. Today, 36 years after this historic instrument was first unveiled in 1978, the MS-20 returns to its true origin.

<DD>Imagine if Tim Cook fired up the production lines and started churning out the Apple II instead of the latest Macbook Pro. The world would think he had gone barking mad. After all, what company in its right mind would decide to start rebuilding technology last manufactured in the 1970s? But in 2013, that was exactly the business decision made by the bosses at Korg, a Japanese multinational corporation that is one of the world’s biggest musical instrument manufacturers. Rather than spend their R&D cash on developing a digital instrument of the future, they decided to start once again building an analog synthesizer called the MS-20, which was considered cutting edge when it was released in 1978 before being dismissed as worthless trash less than a decade later. Their gamble clearly worked, because the instrument sold out across the world. Now its competitors are widely tipped to be considering making the same move, with synth fans hoping that other Japanese giants like Yamaha and...

Half a century later, I started Brain Pickings in large part out of frustration and disappointment with my trampling experience of our culturally fetishized “Ivy League education.” I found myself intellectually and creatively unstimulated by the industrialized model of the large lecture hall, the PowerPoint presentations, the standardized tests assessing my rote memorization of facts rather than my ability to transmute that factual knowledge into a pattern-recognition mechanism that connects different disciplines to cultivate wisdom about how the world works and a moral lens on how it should work. So Brain Pickings became the record of my alternative learning, of that cross-disciplinary curiosity that took me from art to psychology to history to science, by way of the myriad pieces of knowledge I discovered — and connected — on my own.

In the midst of all this came WarGames, a fizzy little thriller about looming Armageddon. It's a deceptively simple story: High schooler David Lightman (played by 21-year-old Matthew Broderick) is a digitally proficient goofball who wants to play an unreleased computer game — and impress a pretty girl (Ally Sheedy). So he does something most Americans didn't have a word for back then: He starts hacking. Little does he know, the "computer company" he's infiltrated is actually a military installation running a missile-command supercomputer called the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), and the game — Global Thermonuclear War — is real. Naturally, only David can stop it from setting off World War III.

<DD>Military planners are sometimes asked to apply a ‘blank sheet test’ to an organization’s structure. This test simply requires the organization’s purpose, expressed as a list of desired organizational outputs. From that list the planner develops, from scratch, the outline of an organization optimized for the outcomes of interest. Frequently, the optimized organization bears little resemblance to the one in existence, and highlights the fact that many organizations have reached their present state by simple momentum and happenstance. Such organizations likely require tailoring and amendment. By contrast, in the case of the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD), one might strongly contend that the blank sheet test would drive planners right back to the NORAD of today. Admittedly, the exercise might not today produce a binational organization, as the uniqueness of such an amalgamation of Canadian and U.S. authorities likely reflects NORAD’s birth at a time of immense threat..

What’s more, it wasn’t written in any ordinary language but in an unintelligible alphabet that appeared to be a conlang — an undertaking so complex it constitutes one of the highest feats of cryptography. It took him nearly three years to complete the project, and three more to publish it, but when it was finally released, the book — a weird and wonderful masterpiece of art and philosophical provocation on the precipice of the information age — attracted a growing following that continued to gather momentum even as the original edition went out of print.

<DD>This paper explores the idea of mutable, audiovisual scores for improvised musical performances through the description of personal perspectives, practical examples, proposed projects, and research. The author postulates that an audiovisual score can be a useful tool to connect improvising musicians to each other and their audience through the insertion of a mediating audiovisual layer within the work. These systems are used as a primary influential agent for an ensemble of improvisers, providing them with a context for a musical conversation. In contrast to traditional notation and graphic scores, audiovisual scores embrace the chaotic ambiguities of environmental influences giving the music the context of unpredictable everyday events. Presenting an unpredictable audiovisual score parallels the indeterminate improvisation of the ensemble. It activates the last vestige of what remains immutable within traditional forms of notation driven performance inserting it into a mutable...

<DD>I got dropped off the double-deck bus which had picked me up at the hotel that morning. The friendly hostess, dressed in matching red, said good-bye, and here I was right in front of the exhibition hall. Enjoying the morning rays of the August sun, I proudly glanced back at this red London double-deck bus with its "digital PDP-8/E OMNIBUSTM" label posted between the two window rows across the giant vehicle (a fitting promotional effort for the novel PDP-8/E minicomputer's I/O bus). Inside at the DEC booth I was struck. A crowd of interested visitors and arguing sales people circled the prominently placed PDP-8/E with its rattling Teletype printer leisurely churning out plots. Next to it was a huge heap of piled-up Small Computer Handbooks, and then there was this big basket filled with red double-deck OMNIBUS toys as take-away gifts for the kids at home. With fascination and great satisfaction I kept watching visitors picking a couple of the OMNIBUS toys...

<DD>In Part 1 of this blog, we started looking at reducing noise, increasing dynamic range, and increasing the ENOB (effective number of bits) with a SAR (successive approximation register) ADC. The method is based on oversampling -- commonly used on low-speed, high resolution delta-sigma ADCs -- less commonly used elsewhere. We continue by looking at some test results with a SAR ADC using an Eval board and its software.

<DD>In my previous blog, Which Is Better: SAR or Delta-Sigma ADCs?, I gave an overview of the delta-sigma and SAR (successive approximation register) ADCs. I discussed the technique of oversampling as it relates to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and effective number of bits (ENOB). The oversampling technique is most often used with the delta-sigma ADC; but it's also useful with the SAR ADC. We will dive in a bit deeper to see how this works. First, a quick summary of the previous blog's important points.

After all, Sting has been perceived as an artist dedicated to his craft; few people associate him as a hawker of goods. Nevertheless, there he was displaying a genuine excitement, a passion that could only be borne from the artist who has found the toy of his dreams. This technology clearly means something to one of rock and roll's most accomplished and stylish practitioners. He loves it, it is his mistress, a mistress that willing succumbs to his whims and delivers all the secret pleasures rampant in a constantly active imagination: Indeed, at times, the Synclavier seems to take on near mythic proportions: "I'm very grateful to the inventors of the Synclavier," he noted, "for making me a whole person, not just a mind." Pretty heady stuff.

<DD>Flexible electronics, also known as flex circuits, is a technology for assembling electronic circuits by mounting electronic devices on flexible plastic substrates, such as polyimide, PEEK or transparent conductive polyester[1] film. Additionally, flex circuits can be screen printed silver circuits on polyester. Flexible electronic assemblies may be manufactured using identical components used for rigid printed circuit boards, allowing the board to conform to a desired shape, or to flex during its use. These flexible printed circuits (FPC) are made with a photolithographic technology. An alternative way of making flexible foil circuits or flexible flat cables (FFCs) is laminating very thin (0.07 mm) copper strips in between two layers of PET. These PET layers, typically 0.05 mm thick, are coated with an adhesive which is thermosetting, and will be activated during the lamination process.

<DD>In cryptography, an initialization vector (IV) or starting variable (SV)[1] is a fixed-size input to a cryptographic primitive that is typically required to be random or pseudorandom. Randomization is crucial for encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme under the same key does not allow an attacker to infer relationships between segments of the encrypted message. For block ciphers, the use of an IV is described by so-called modes of operation. Randomization is also required for other primitives, such as universal hash functions and message authentication codes based thereon.

<DD>In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that hashes a password or passphrase.[1] The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks and pre-computed rainbow table attacks. A new salt is randomly generated for each password. In a typical setting, the salt and the password are concatenated and processed with a cryptographic hash function, and the resulting output (but not the original password) is stored with the salt in a database. Hashing allows for later authentication while defending against compromise of the plaintext password in the event that the database is somehow compromised. Cryptographic salts are broadly used in many modern computer systems, from Unix system credentials to Internet security.

<DD>In security engineering, a nonce is an arbitrary number used only once in a cryptographic communication. It is similar in spirit to a nonce word, hence the name. It is often a random or pseudo-random number issued in an authentication protocol to ensure that old communications cannot be reused in replay attacks. For instance, nonces are used in HTTP digest access authentication to calculate an MD5 digest of the password. The nonces are different each time the 401 authentication challenge response code is presented, thus making replay attacks virtually impossible.

<DD>We already know the NSA wants to eavesdrop on the internet. It has secret agreements with telcos to get direct access to bulk internet traffic. It has massive systems like TUMULT, TURMOIL, and TURBULENCE to sift through it all. And it can identify ciphertext — encrypted information — and figure out which programs could have created it. But what the NSA wants is to be able to read that encrypted information in as close to real-time as possible. It wants backdoors, just like the cybercriminals and less benevolent governments do. And we have to figure out how to make it harder for them, or anyone else, to insert those backdoors.

You’ve almost certainly heard them invoked, correctly or otherwise, to describe things that look or act the same at the large scale as they do at the small. You may even know the name Benoit Mandelbrot, the much-laureled Polish-French-American “father of fractal geometry.” Hard science-fiction titan Arthur C. Clarke called his eponymous set of mathematical points “one of the most astonishing discoveries in the entire history of mathematics.” Nassim Nicholas Taleb, the famously discriminating author of The Black Swan, called him ”the only person for whom I have had intellectual respect.” Even former French president Nicolas Sarkozy gave Mandelbrot his props, crediting his discoveries of the geometrical regularities of “rough” things, from coastlines to stock-market fluctuations, as antecedent to modern information theory.

<DD>The USAF AN/FSQ-7 (SAGE) computer systems were the largest computers ever built, and were responsible for keeping a radar eye on our air space for more than 25 years until decommissioned in 1983. The Q7 was also a special effects dream, with more lights, switches and vacuum tubes than any other piece of hardware, and found its way into many science fiction movies and television programs over the years. I served in the US Air Force from 1982 until 1986, and was in one of the last groups of computer maintenance technicians trained to work on the Q7. I was stationed at McChord AFB in Tacoma, WA, and worked on the Q7 there from January through August of 1983, before heading back to school for training on the newer (ROCC) system. McChord's Q7 was finally turned off in August of 1983. I've been a science fiction fan ever since I could read, and have always been fascinated by robots and computers, the more lights and switches the better.

<DD>The United States government powered up its SAGE defense system in July 1958, at an Air Force base near Trenton, New Jersey. Short for Semi-Automatic Ground Environment, SAGE would eventually span 24 command and control stations across the US and Canada, warning against potential air attacks via radar and an early IBM computer called the AN/FSQ-7. "It automated air defense," says Mike Loewen, who worked with SAGE while serving with the Air Force in the 1980s. "It used a versatile, programmable, digital computer to process all this incoming radar data from various sites around the region and display it in a format that made sense to people. It provided a computer display of the digitally processed radar information." Fronted by a wall of dials, switches, neon lights, and incandescent lamps -- and often plugged into spinning tape drives stretching from floor to ceiling -- the AN/FSQ-7 looked like one of those massive computing systems that turned up in Hollywood movies and...

<DD>Temperature sensors are used in diverse applications such as food processing, HVAC environmental control, medical devices, chemical handling and automotive under the hood monitoring (e.g., coolant, air intake, cylinder head temperatures, etc.). Temperature sensors tend to measure heat to ensure that a process is either; staying within a certain range, providing safe use of that application, or meeting a mandatory condition when dealing with extreme heat, hazards, or inaccessible measuring points. There are two main flavors: contact and noncontact temperature sensors. Contact sensors include thermocouples and thermistors that touch the object they are to measure, and noncontact sensors measure the thermal radiation a heat source releases to determine its temperature. The latter group measures temperature from a distance and often are used in hazardous environments.

It was a 58 cm (23 in) diameter polished metal sphere, with four external radio antennae to broadcast radio pulses. The Soviet Union launched it into an elliptical low Earth orbit on October 4, 1957. It was visible all around the Earth and its radio pulses detectable. The surprise success precipitated the American Sputnik crisis, began the Space Age and triggered the Space Race, a part of the larger Cold War. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments.

<DD>This TI Verified Design is a high performance data acquisition system (DAQ) using an 18-bit SAR ADC, ADS8881 at a throughput of 1MSPS. This design has been optimized to provide the lowest noise & distortion solution for a full scale input sinewave of 10 KHz. This leads to a maximum possible value for Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) at a total power consumption of less than 50mW. The input driver for the ADC uses the fully-differential THS4521 for extremely low distortion, noise and high small signal bandwidth. The reference buffer drive utilizes a composite buffer made out of THS4281 & OPA333 to get the desired performance at lowest power consumption. See more TI Precision Designs

<DD>Voice announcements of Eastern Time are made at ten-second intervals, followed by a tone whose beginning indicates the exact time. This service is available to the general public by dialling the Ottawa telephone numbers 613-745-1576 for English service and 613-745-9426 for French service. The time signal also &quot;ticks&quot; each second to facilitate accurate counting down for setting digital chronometers. Three announcements are given, and the caller is then disconnected. The lines are busiest between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., and 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., so callers are encouraged to make their time checks at other times, if possible. Long distance charges apply for calls originating from locations outside the Ottawa area, and the caller is responsible for these charges. NRC's time laboratory has sought to expand this service Canada-wide on a no-charge basis, but every option examined to date has been too expensive.

<DD>These instruments are the culmination of a three-year long project in which the designers worked closely with dancers, musicians, composers and a choreographer. The goal of the project was to develop instruments that are visually striking, utilize advanced sensing technologies, and are rugged enough for extensive use in performance. The complex, transparent shapes are lit from within, and include articulated spines, curved visors and ribcages. Unlike most computer music control interfaces, they function both as hand-held, manipulable controllers and as wearable, movement-tracking extensions to the body. Further, since the performers can smoothly attach and detach the objects, these new instruments deliberately blur the line between the performers' bodies and the instrument being played.

<DD>On July 9, 1962, the United States Air Force launched a 2,200-pound W-49 nuclear warhead into space. It exploded with a yield of 1.44 megatons 248 miles above the Pacific Ocean. Starfish Prime, the most powerful and highest space nuclear test ever conducted, produced a flash of light visible over much of the Pacific. For seven minutes after the explosion, an artificial red aurora danced in the skies over island groups as widely separated as Hawaii, Tonga, and Samoa (image at top of post). The blast’s electromagnetic pulse damaged electrical systems on Oahu, 800 miles away from the explosion.

<DD>During the summer of 1963, Earth looked a tiny bit like Saturn. The same year that Martin Luther King, Jr. marched on Washington and Beatlemania was born, the United States launched half a billion whisker-thin copper wires into orbit in an attempt to install a ring around the Earth. It was called Project West Ford, and it’s a perfect, if odd, example of the Cold War paranoia and military mentality at work in America’s early space program. The Air Force and Department of Defense envisioned the West Ford ring as the largest radio antenna in human history. Its goal was to protect the nation’s long-range communications in the event of an attack from the increasingly belligerent Soviet Union.

<DD>The oriental cockroach (Blatta orientalis), also known as the waterbug, is a large species of cockroach, measuring about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length at maturity. It is dark brown to black in color and has a glossy body. The female Oriental cockroach has a somewhat different appearance to the male, appearing to be wingless at casual glance but has two very short and useless wings just below her head. She has a wider body than the male. The male has long wings, which cover a majority of his body and are brown in color, and has a narrower body. The odd male is capable of very short flights, ranging about 2 to 3 meters. The female oriental cockroach looks somewhat similar to the Florida woods cockroach, and may be mistaken for it.

<DD>Seismic unrest, indicative of subsurface magma transport and pressure changes within fluid-filled cracks and conduits, often precedes volcanic eruptions. An intriguing form of volcano seismicity is harmonic tremor, that is, sustained vibrations in the range of 0.5–5 Hz. Many source processes can generate harmonic tremor. Harmonic tremor in the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano, Alaska, has been linked to repeating earthquakes of magnitudes around 0.5–1.5 that occur a few kilometres beneath the vent. Before many explosions in that eruption, these small earthquakes occurred in such rapid succession—up to 30 events per second—that distinct seismic wave arrivals blurred into continuous, high-frequency tremor. Tremor abruptly ceased about 30 s before the explosions. Here we introduce a frictional-faulting model to evaluate the credibility and implications of this tremor mechanism. We find that the fault stressing rates rise to values ten orders of magnitude ...

<DD>Monolayer graphene exhibits exceptional electronic and mechanical properties, making it a very promising material for nanoelectromechanical (NEMS) devices. Here, we conclusively demonstrate the piezoresistive effect in graphene in a nano-electromechanical membrane configuration that provides direct electrical readout of pressure to strain transduction. This makes it highly relevant for an important class of nano-electromechanical system (NEMS) transducers. This demonstration is consistent with our simulations and previously reported gauge factors and simulation values. The membrane in our experiment acts as a strain gauge independent of crystallographic orientation and allows for aggressive size scalability. When compared with conventional pressure sensors, the sensors have orders of magnitude higher sensitivity per unit area.

<DD>Douglas Engelbart — the father of the computer mouse and so many of the other basic concepts that drive our personal machines and the modern internet — has died at the age of 88. According to an email from his daughter, posted to a mailing list dedicated to classic computers, Engelbart died “peacefully” in his sleep at his home in Atherton, California. In the late 1960s, at the Stanford Research Institute, or SRI, in Menlo Park, California, Engelbart oversaw the creation of NLS, a system that provided instant communication over a computer network — including what we now call video conferencing — and paired a mouse with a graphical user interface 15 years before the arrival of the Apple Macintosh.

<DD>Bats and moths have been engaged in aerial warfare for nearly 65 Myr. This arms race has produced a suite of counter-adaptations in moths, including bat-detecting ears. One set of defensive strategies involves the active production of sound; tiger moths' ultrasonic replies to bat attack have been shown to startle bats, warn the predators of bad taste and jam their biosonar. Here, we report that hawkmoths in the Choerocampina produce entirely ultrasonic sounds in response to tactile stimulation and the playback of biosonar attack sequences. Males do so by grating modified scraper scales on the outer surface of the genital valves against the inner margin of the last abdominal tergum. Preliminary data indicate that females also produce ultrasound to touch and playback of echolocation attack, but they do so with an entirely different mechanism. The anti-bat function of these sounds is unknown but might include startling, cross-family acoustic mimicry, warning of unprofitability or physi...

<DD>Google recently released Street View imagery for Hashima, an abandoned island off the coast of Nagasaki Prefecture in Japan more commonly known by its nickname Gunkanjima, or “Battleship Island.” The eerie island, which opened up to tourism in 2009 after being abandoned in the mid 1970s, also served as the inspiration for the villain Raoul Silva’s lair in Skyfall.

<DD>Intel HEX is a file format for conveying binary information for applications like programming microcontrollers, EPROMs, and other kinds of chips. In a typical application, a compiler or assembler converts a program's source code (such as in C or assembly language) to machine code and outputs it into a HEX file. That file is then imported by a programmer to &quot;burn&quot; the machine code into a ROM, or is transferred to the target system for loading and execution.

<DD>The Motorola S-record format is an ASCII hexadecimal (&quot;hex&quot;) text encoding for binary data. It is also known as the SREC[1] or S19[2] format. Each record contains a checksum to detect data that has been corrupted during transmission. The first record (S0) may include arbitrary comments such as a program name or version number.[3] The last (termination) record (S7, S8, or S9) may include a starting address.[3] The S-record format was created in the 1970s for the Motorola 6800 processor. Software development tools for that and other embedded processors would make executable code and data in the S-record format. PROM programmers would then read the S-record format and &quot;burn&quot; the data into the PROMs or EPROMs used in the embedded system.

<DD>Vast landscapes extending from southern Angola, Namibia, and South Africa exhibit localised barren patches of vegetation called fairy circles. They consist of isolated or randomly distributed circular areas devoid of any vegetation. They are surrounded by fringes of tall grasses and are embedded in a sparse grassland on sandy soils. When the aridity increases, the size of the fairy circles increases and can reach diameters up to 10m. Although several hypotheses have been proposed, the origin of this phenomenon remains unsolved. We show that a simple non-local model of plant ecology based on realistic assumptions provides a quantitative explanation of this phenomenon. Fairy circles result from strong interaction between interfaces connecting two uniform covers: the uniform grassland and the bare states, and their stabilisation is attributed to the Lorentzian-like non-local coupling that models the competition between plants. The cause of their formation in thus rather inherent to the...

<DD>The Transistor Amplifier is available as a .pdf but this file is not updated as fast as the web page. New items are added on a daily basis as we get a lot of requests from readers to help design a circuit and explain how a circuit works. We have not opted for covering transistor circuit design as found in most text books because there are many available on the web for free download. We have decided to cover this topic in a completely different way, with a circuit to cover each explanation. This way you will pick up all the pointers that the text books miss. It's only after you start designing a circuit that you find out how little you have been supplied via conventional teaching and that's why our approach is so important. If you look at the Indian magazines you will find faults and poor descriptions in almost every one of their circuits. No only is the designer poorly informed but the technical editor of the magazine is unaware of the mistakes and the readers do not reply with corr...

Cipra, January 1993)</A>
<DD>In this so-called Age of Information, no one need be reminded of the importance not only of speed but also of accuracy in the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data. It's more than a question of "Garbage In, Garbage Out." Machines do make errors, and their non-man-made mistakes can turn otherwise flawless programming into worthless, even dangerous, trash. Just as architects design buildings that will remain standing even through an earthquake, their computer counterparts have come up with sophisticated techniques capable of counteracting the digital manifestations of Murphy's Law. What many might be unaware of, though, is the significance, in all this modern technology, of a five-page paper that appeared in 1960 in the Journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The paper, "Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields," by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon, then staff members at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, introduced ideas that form the core of current error-...

Today we'll be checking out the DHT11, DHT22 and AM2302 humidity and temperature sensors available from Adafruit In this tutorial we'll be showing how to utilize C for high-speed GPIO polling to handle bit-banged sensor output. Many low cost sensors have unusual output formats, and in this case, a "Manchester-esque" output that is not SPI, I2C or 1-Wire compatible must be polled continuously by the Pi to decode. Luckily, the C GPIO libraries are fast enough to decode the output. Once we have that working, we add the fun of Python to update a google spreadsheet live with the temperature/humidity data.

<DD>The Sierpinski triangle (also with the original orthography Sierpiński), also called the Sierpinski gasket or the Sierpinski Sieve, is a fractal and attractive fixed set named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński who described it in 1915. However, similar patterns appear already in the 13th-century Cosmati mosaics in the cathedral of Anagni, Italy,[1] and other places, such as in the nave of the Roman Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin.[2] Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e. it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction. Comparing the Sierpinski triangle or the Sierpinski carpet to equivalent repetitive tiling arrangements, it is evident that similar structures can be built into any rep-tile arrangements.

<DD>Backpropagation, an abbreviation for "backward propagation of errors", is a common method of training artificial neural networks. From a desired output, the network learns from many inputs, similar to the way a child learns to identify a dog from examples of dogs. It is a supervised learning method, and is a generalization of the delta rule. It requires a dataset of the desired output for many inputs, making up the training set. It is most useful for feed-forward networks (networks that have no feedback, or simply, that have no connections that loop). Backpropagation requires that the activation function used by the artificial neurons (or "nodes") be differentiable.

Alan Turing set in motion the computer age and his World War II codebreaking helped save two million lives. Yet few people have heard his name, know his tragic story, or understand his legacy. In 1954, Turing committed suicide at age 41 after being forced to undergo hormone therapy to 'fix' his sexual orientation. He left behind a lasting legacy and lingering questions about what else he might have accomplished if society had embraced his unique genius instead of rejecting it. 100 years after his birth, an international production team takes viewers on a journey to rediscover the man and the mystery.

The temperature then dropped a surprising 11 degrees when the Salado Creek greenway was crossed before returning to 64 degrees. Elsewhere, rural gravel pits, roads, subdivisions and factories produce localized warming. Eventually the heat islands of expanding cities reach weather stations and lead to artificially warm long-term temperature records.

A Critique of Reinhart and Rogo ff</A>
<DD>Herndon, Ash and Pollin replicate Reinhart and Rogoff and find that coding errors, selective exclusion of available data, and unconventional weighting of summary statistics lead to serious errors that inaccurately represent the relationship between public debt and GDP growth among 20 advanced economies in the post-war period. They find that when properly calculated, the average real GDP growth rate for countries carrying a public-debt-to-GDP ratio of over 90 percent is actually 2.2 percent, not -0:1 percent as published in Reinhart and Rogo ff. That is, contrary to RR, average GDP growth at public debt/GDP ratios over 90 percent is not dramatically different than when debt/GDP ratios are lower. The authors also show how the relationship between public debt and GDP growth varies significantly by time period and country. Overall, the evidence we review contradicts Reinhart and Rogoff 's claim to have identified an important stylized fact, that public debt loads greater than 90 perc...

Seen on an oscilloscope with a slow sweep it has a wandering baseline (figure 1) because the high frequency noise rides on larger low frequency content. Pink noise, another metaphoric name, also suggests the stronger low frequency component. Flicker noise seems ever present in physical systems and life science.

<DD>The most obvious method for determining the distor- tion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal con ditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for m...

<DD>A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two “function spaces,” and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of “ideal” systems which transmit at this maximum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.

<DD>This video, via Xiph.org, offers a deep exploration of the multiple facets of digital audio signals and how they really behave in the real world. As a bonus, it’s done with old-school analog gear! Host Monty Montgomery continues the “firehose” tradition of maximum information density from his earlier video, A Digital Media Primer For Geeks. He covers sampling, quantization, bit-depth, and dither, using both modern digital analysis and vintage analog bench equipment. Check it out and let us know what you think!

<DD>A new campaign for indigenous rights and environmental justice is spreading across Canada. The "Idle No More" movement began as a series of protests against a controversial government budget bill, but has since expanded into a nationwide movement for political transformation. Aboriginal and environmental activists are calling on Prime Minister Stephen Harper to honor treaties with aborigines; open dialogue with environmentalists; and reject tar sands pipelines that would infiltrate First Nation territories. We go to Toronto to speak with Pamela Palmater, Chair in Indigenous Governance at Ryerson University and spokeswoman for the "Idle No More" movement. "We, First Nations people, have been subsidizing the wealth and prosperity and programs and services of Canadians from our land and resources," Palmater says. "And that’s the reality here that most people don’t understand."

<DD>Programmable active filters have increased in popularity over the past decade. With the advent of switched capacitor topologies, filter parameters such as the natural frequency and filter Q can be changed simply by varying the clock frequency. But switched capacitor filters are sampled data systems and are subject to anomalies such as clock feedthrough noise and aliasing errors. The circuit in Figure 1 shows how an analog, digitally programmable filter can be built using a UAF42. This monolithic, state-variable active filter chip provides a two pole filter building block with low sensitivity to external component variations. It eliminates aliasing errors and clock feedthrough noise common to switched capacitor filters. Lowpass, highpass, bandpass and notch (band reject) out- puts are available simultaneously.

Now more than 400 million CC-licensed works are available on the Internet, from music and photos, to research findings and entire college courses. Creative Commons created the legal and technical infrastructure that allows effective sharing of knowledge, art and data by individuals, organizations and governments. More importantly, millions of creators took advantage of that infrastructure to share work that enriches the global commons for all humanity. The Power of Open collects the stories of those creators.

<DD>A capacitor stores a direct current electrical charge. It will pass an AC waveform and block a DC level. It consists in simple form of two parallel conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a Dielectric. The IDEAL capacitor would have infinite ability to block DC (infinite resistance), would have zero series resistance, infinite voltage handling ability, and zero series inductance, and zero temperature coefficient.

<DD>The XBee Internet Gateway (XIG) is a Python script for Digi’s ConnectPort wireless to ethernet gateway which lets you connect your XBee wireless modules to the internet fairly easily. Jordan Husney, lead programmer of the XIG project, has started releasing a series videos all about XIG and what you can do with it. In the first video, Jordan introduces XIG and walks through the process of setting up the gateway. The XIG is also discussed in Rob Faludi’s Building Wireless Sensor Networks and is a core component of my own Networked On Air Light project. If you’re looking for a way to put your project online using wireless mesh networking, be sure to check out XIG.

<DD>Stanford has been offering portions of its robotics coursework online for a few years now, but professors Sebastian Thrun and Peter Norvig are kicking things up a notch (okay, lots of notches) with next semester's CS221: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. For the first time, you can take this course, along with several hundred Stanford undergrads, without having to fill out an application, pay tuition, or live in a dorm.

<DD>Last week an adjudicator at the Public Service Labour Relations Board handed down rulings related to three Health Canada scientists that confirm what many Canadians — and international observers — had already concluded: that Canada is not a safe place for honest employees, especially if they work for the federal government. After four-and-a-half years of proceedings, it took a further year for the adjudicator to deliver his 208-page decision, which dismissed seven out of eight grievances and ordered one whistleblower reinstated — but not the others. Having followed this case closely from the start, the end result seems absurd to me — as do the reasons given for treating one scientist differently from the others.

Pioneering '50s Synthesizer unearthed in French Barn -- Engadget</A>
<DD>So there Dr. Mick Grierson was, wandering around a French barn, minding his own business when all of a sudden he happened upon an antique: one of the earliest modern synthesizers. Grierson, a professor at Goldsmiths University in London did what any expert in the field of electronic music would do, and whisked it back to the motherland for restoration. The Oram "Oramics" Synthesiser (sic) was built by Daphne Oram in 1957, a year before she co-founded the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to research and develop electronic music. Political wrangling within the corporation forced her to leave in 1959, and she retreated to a farm in nearby Kent to tinker with her invention. After her departure, the Workshop shot to fame for creating the original electronic theme to Doctor Who. In order to create music on the Oram, a composer painted waveforms directly onto 35mm film strips which were fed into the machine. Inside, photo-electronic cells read the light pattern and interpreted it as sound.

<DD>Robert Metcalfe is an intriguing character. He holds several university degrees, writes a nationally syndicated tech column, has for several years run a 400-acre farm in Maine, and in 1979 cofounded a little Silicon Valley business called 3Com. And one other thing – along with good buddy David Boggs, he invented Ethernet. That’s right. Invented. Ethernet. But Metcalfe is also responsible for some of the more notable tech-centric quotes and forecasts of our time. In 1995 he prognosticated a full-blown Internet collapse for the following year. Soon thereafter, he predicted the downfall of wireless networking. Yet as wrong as he was on both counts, Metcalfe was just as right when he famously said of his long-time stomping grounds, “Silicon Valley is the only place on Earth not trying to figure out how to become Silicon Valley.

<DD>Spime is a neologism for a futuristic object, characteristic to the Internet of Things, that can be tracked through space and time throughout its lifetime. They are essentially virtual master objects that can, at various times, have physical incarnations of itself. An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored in the cloud. Bruce Sterling sees spimes as coming through the convergence of six emerging technologies, related to both the manufacturing process for consumer goods, and through identification and location technologies. Depending on context, the term "spime" can refer to both—the archetype, as designed by the developer, or a user-specific instance of it.

<DD>Abstract: This comprehensive article covers all aspects of analog filters. It first addresses the basic types: first- and second-order filters, highpass and lowpass filters, notch and all-pass filters, and high-order filters. The tutorial then explains the characteristics of the different implementations, such as Butterworth filters, Chebychev filters, Bessel filters, elliptic filters, state-variable filters, and switched-capacitor filters.

<DD>Sara Bannerman has an important post that notes how the growing importance of electronic books has particularly implications for the forthcoming copyright bill. As devices such as the Kindle and iPad become increasingly popular, more and more people with purchase their books electronically with DRM included. As Bannerman notes: For many books, and especially academic ones, the price for the ebook is the same (sometimes hundreds of dollars) as it was for the print edition. Canadians shouldn't live in a world of expiring and disappearing books. Consumers should have the right to use books the way they're used to doing – to buy them and have them for life, and to use them for years to come on future generations of devices.

<DD>The cgitb module provides a special exception handler for Python scripts. (Its name is a bit misleading. It was originally designed to display extensive traceback information in HTML for CGI scripts. It was later generalized to also display this information in plain text.) After this module is activated, if an uncaught exception occurs, a detailed, formatted report will be displayed. The report includes a traceback showing excerpts of the source code for each level, as well as the values of the arguments and local variables to currently running functions, to help you debug the problem. Optionally, you can save this information to a file instead of sending it to the browser.

<DD>Visualisingdata.com provides readers with a rich variety of content that charts the development of the data visualisation field as well as profiling the professional services on offer from Visualising Data Ltd. The site is managed and edited by Andy Kirk. The site was launched in February 2010 primarily as a blogging platform to share news and thoughts about the increasingly popular world of data visualisation. Over time, as the field has continued to spread and mature, the site has reflected this growth. It now features a wide range of fresh content profiling latest projects and contemporary techniques, discourse about practical and theoretical matters, commentary about key issues and collections of valuable references and resources. It aims to straddle the divide across the diverse makeup of the visualisation field: whether you are a seasoned expert, an informed practitioner or just a casual enthusiast, there should be plentiful information of interest to you.

<DD>Object hyperlinking, or simply 'phylinking', is a neologism that usually refers to extending the Internet to objects and locations in the real world. The current Internet does not extend beyond the electronic realm. Object hyperlinking aims to extend the Internet to the physical world by attaching tags with URLs to tangible objects or locations. These object tags can then be read by a wireless mobile device and information about objects and locations retrieved and displayed. However, object hyperlinking may be senseful in other context than with the Internet, e.g. with data objects in data base administering or with text content management.

<DD>This rare unit was being tossed out by my college as it had been in service since '82. I snatched it up because it had a really cool design, and I had a us for it as an interface to my micro board. Unfortunately, however is was dirty and permanently yellowed from age. This would not do in my house! So I thought the best way to restore it was a paint for plastic. I completely disassembled the unit and keyboard, and painted all parts that were originally white.This turned out better than expected. It's nearly perfect! Looking at it reassembled now, you can't tell it wasn't taken out of the box new.
